Reading 7-9
1. traditional finance v. behavioral finance
- traditional
  people are risk-averse, self-interested, utility maximizers (rational)
  people make decisions with utility theory, revise expectations with Bayes' formula
  people have access to perfect info, and can process it in an unbiased way
  price reflect all available and relevant info
- behavioral
  people are loss-averse, satisfying, with bounded rationality

2. decision-making process
[1] normative analysis
    rational solution - traditional 
[2] descriptive analysis 
    real people work - behavioral 
[3] prescriptive analysis
    predict results - behavioral
    
3. utility theory - traditional
four axioms of utility
- completeness 
  known choices and preferences
- transitivity
  consistent rankings
- independence
  additive and divisible utilities
- continuity
  smooth and unbroken indifference curves
  
4. challenges to traditional finance
- bounded rationality/ difficulty prioritizing short-term goals/ not perfect info
  not constantly risk-averse (lottery and insurance)
  Friedman-Savage double-inflection utility function: concave (risk-averse) at sides, convex (risk-seeking) in the middle
  
5. prospect theory
- risk-averse gain, risk-seeking loss (people are loss-aversion)
- editing process (early phase) + evaluation process (later phase)
- editing process
  codification/ combination/ segregation/ cancellation/ simplification/ detection of dominace

6. EMH
- weak-form
  mkt info are assumed, technical analysis do not work
- semi-strong form
  mkt and fundamental info are assumed, fundamental analysis do not work
- strong form  
  all info are assumed, nothing will work
  
7. mkt anomalies
- fundamental - size effect/ value effect
- tech - moving averages/ support and resistance
- calendar - January effect

8. four behavioral finance models
[1] consumption and savings
- framing (how do you say sth.)
- self-control (short-term spending)
- mental accounting (salary and bonus)
[2] behavioral asset pricing
discount rate on security = risk-free rate + fundamental risk premium + sentiment premium
[3] behavioral portfolio theory (BPT)
construct portfolios in layers by expectations of the performance (goal-based/pyramid/mental accouting)
[4] adaptive mkts hypothesis
success is survival, rather than maximizing utility (because things change)

9. cognitive errors
[1] belief perservance (RICCH)
- conservatism bias (not consider new info)
- confirmation bias (ignore contradicting info)
- representativeness bias (judge new info using past experience/ base rate neglect + sample size neglect)
- illusion of control
- hindsight bias

[2] info-processing biases (FAMA)
- anchoring and adjustment
- mental accounting bias
- framing bias
- availability bias (estimate the probability based on availability)

10. emotional biases (harder to correct) (LOSSER)
- loss aversion bias
- overconfidence bias 
  illusion of knowledge = prediction overconfidence + certainty overconfidence
  self-attribution = self-enhancing + self-protective (take credit for success and throw mistakes away)
- self-control bias
- status quo bias
- endowment bias
- regret-aversion bias (do nothing out of fear)

11. behaviorally modified asset allocation
SLR - standard pf living risk (to maintain current life style)
suggested deviation from rational portfolio
higher to lower: emotional - cognitive/ low SLR - high SLR

12. classifying investors
[1] Barnewall 2-way
    passive (salary) / active (creation)
[2] BB&K
    careful & confident - individualist
    careful & anxious - guardian
    impetuous & confident - adventure
    impetuous & anxious - celebrity
[3] Pompian
    by risk tolerance up
    PP - passive perserver 
    FF - freiendly follower
    II - independent individualist
    AA - active accumulator
    emotional bias - PP AA, cognitive bias - FF II
    
13. behavioral problems with DC plan
- status quo bias - target date funds
- naive diversification (equal weight)
- familiarity and over-confidence
- naive extrapolation of past futures
- financial incentives - buy stock @ discount

14. behavioral problems with excess trading
- disposition effect (sell winners and hold on to losers)
- home bias (availablity bias)

15. other biases
gamblers' fallacy (10 white, the 11th must be red)
social proof (peer pressure)
momentum effect
herding (herd of sheep)
trend-chasing effect (regret)
halo effect (good company = good investment?)


Note:
1. E(Utility) = sum over prob_i * subjective prob factor_i * Utility_i
2. bounded rationality(satisficing)
   -> investors attempt to make the most rational decision possible based on an amount of information they deem satisfactory
3. only in inefficient market may sophisticated investor have an advantage
4. errors that cause momentum effect
   -> overconfidence/ confirmation/ herding/ regretion/ availability/ hindsight
5. limitations in classifying investors
   exhibit characteristics of multiple investor/ exhibit both emotional and cognitive/ behavioral changes as aging
6. mental accounting = BPT = constructed in layers = goal-based -> inefficient
7. behaviroal asset pricing -> add sentiment premium to discount rate
   adaptive mkt hypothesis (AMH) -> apply heuristics until they no long work, and then adjust
   satisfying than maxing utility -> savings and consumption/ BPT/ AMH
8. KYC -> works better with investor with cognitive errors rather than emotional biases
9. familiar investing -> does not mean investing things you have invested before, but things you see in real life (your company stock)
9. anchoring trap -> overweight info you first receive
   recalability trap -> overweight castrophic/dramatic event
   prudence trap -> temper forecast to be not extreme
