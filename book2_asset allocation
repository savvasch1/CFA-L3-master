Reading 12 - 14

1. investment governance
- governance hierarchy
  investment committee - approve, delegate, oversight, audit
  investment staff - draft, research, evaluate, create, assess
  third-party resources - consult
- governance models 
  
2. enonomic balance sheet
- asset
  domestic equity + PV of expected future income
- libility
  short-term borrowing + PV of expected future consumption
- equtiy
  economic net worth
  
3. approaches to asset allocation
- asset-only
  for ones without debts
  risk measure: volatility/tracking error/max drawdown/VaR
- ALM
  for most institutional investors
  risk measure: shortfall risk
- goal-based
  for individual
  risk measure: prob(not achieve goal)
  
4. asset classes
criteria: homogeneous (within)/ mutually exclusive/ diversifying/ largely exhaustive

5. isolate risk factor (pure-factor portfolio)
- inflation
  long nominal Treasuries, short inflation-linked bond
  -> TIPS is a kind of inflation-linked bond, whose value is only affected by real int rate, and not affected by inflation
  -> inflation factor = nominal Treasuries (real int rate + inflation) - inflation-linked bond (real int rate)
- real int rates
  inflation-linked bond
- US volatility
  VIX future
- credit spread
  long high-spread bond, short Treasuries
- duration
  long 10-year Treasuies, short 1-year Treasuries
 
6. strategic asset allocation
 - TAA (tactical)
   short-term deviation
 - DAA (dynamic)
   long-term changes due to changes in CME
   
7. rebalancing
 - calendar/ percent-range (trigger points or range)
 - range are affected by (wider range - less likely to rebalance)
   core -> prob(deviation from SAA)/ do less rebalancing
   pos relative -> transanction cost/ risk tolerance/ asset class correlation/ belief in momentum
   neg relative -> volatility(not quite intuitive)/ taxes (rebalance with loss can create a tax shield)/ belief in mean-reversion
 - effects
   better diversification/ short volatility

8. asset-only
MVO
- no short selling
  i.e. not negative weights, some points on the frontier are not attainable
  interpolation may be used to synthesize the target return
- with risk-free asset
  choose a portfolio on the frontier, with which it forms the highest sharpe ratio
cons:  
- highly concentrated   (add constraints)
- highly sensitive to inputs (resamplesd MVO, reversed MVO, BL)
  resampled MVO = MVO + MCS - run many frontiers, then average
  cons: could have concave bumps/ over-diversifed/ inherit the estimation errors/ no foundation in theory
  reversed MVO: use global portfolio wgts to reversely calculate implied risk and return
                global -> include all investable asset, minimizes diversifiable risk
- not account for skewness and kurtosis (non-normal optimization)
  mean-semivariance/ mean-conditional VaR/ mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis
- liquidity
  exclude less liquid asset/ replace with liquid similar asset
- risk factor may not be diversified (risk-budgeting and factor-based model)
  factor—based model - construct the frontier of risk factors, run the optimized combo, then map back to assets
- single-period framework (MCS method)
  cons: frequent rebalancing/ path dependent (next path depends on previous path)
- not account for liability or consumption

9. ALM
[1] surplus optimization
surplus return = (d_asset - d_liability)/asset
- return of liability use corporate bond as proxy
- compare to AO, ALM could have negative-value frontier, risk-free asset is corporate bond
[2] hedging/return-seeking portfolio approach
hedging covers liability, return-seeking is managed separately
may require an over-funded status

10. goal-based
[1] determine discount rate
    time horizon/ required probability of success
[2] allocate capital to sub-portfolios
    calculate the lowest initally required capital for each goal
[3] if have excess capital
    bring forward the timing or raise the sucess probability of current goals/ get additional goals

11. heuristic approaches
120 - age% to stocks
60/40 stock/bond
Yale model - higher allocations to non-traditional assets (liquidity premium)
1/N - naive diversification

12. risk budgeting and risk parity
risk budgeting
MCTR (marginal contribution to total risk) = beta_i * sigma_p
excess return to MCTR = (expected return - risk-free rate)/MCTR
choose the asset with highest ratio
ACTR (absolute contribution to total risk) = w_i * MCTR = w_i * beta_i * sigma_p

risk parity
equal ACTR among all asset
ACTR = w_i * beta_i * sigma_p = (1/n) * sigma_p
cons: ignores expected return/ no available leverage to increase the return/ look-back bias

13. constraints
[1] asset size
- cons of large asset
  illiquidity/ mkt impact in small-cap/ outside of core investment thesis/ slow down decision making
- cons of small asset
  threshold/ lower governance capacity/ lower fees/ hard to diversify
[2] liquidity
- people have different liquidity needs
- liquidity needs can change
[3] time horizon
- changing human capital
- changing character of liabilities
[4] regulatory
[5] tax
- after-tax portfolio optimization
  less tax on price appreciation than dividend income
  tax can reduce risk
  smaller rebalancing range for taxable portfolio
- tax loss harvesting
  only realized gains are taxable, realized loss are tax-deductable
- TA/TDA/TEA
  higher tax put in TEA/TDA, lower tax put in TA
  bond put in TDA (coupon), stock put in TA (price appreciation)
  
14. SAA v. TAA
ways to evaluate TAA decisions
Sharpe ratio or info ratio/ t-stat of difference/ plot risk and return on SAA frontier


Note:
1. a young women with no debt and expected inheritence starting a job is considered high capacity for risk and no financial capital
2. for preexistent positions of a client
   [1] ignoring the positions and running MVO for the rest of the client’s portfolio
   [2] modeling the specific characteristics of what that client actually owns
   [3] using data on public funds but realizing that such data will not reflect the specific characteristics of the client’s positions
3. for incorporating client risk preferences into asset allocations
   [1] specifying additional constraints
   [2] specifying a risk aversion factor for the investor
   [3] using MCS
4. MVO can address taxes in a single- period model and MCS is not necessary
   MCS becomes useful in dealing with a multi- period framework, where the analysis of taxes and rebalancing becomes much more mathematically challenging otherwise
5. ALM 
   Integrated asset-liability approach -> take liability as a variable
   Surplus efficient frontier approach/Two-portfolio approach -> take the liabilities as a given and only focus on managing the assets
5. deviation(rebalancing range)_pretax = deviation(rebalancing range)_aftertax  * (1-tax rate)
6. within the same goal's layer, investment horizon affect the risk tolerance level of each goal
   education/medical is not necessarily more risk-averse than charity
7. max sharpe ratio given a range of volatility -> AO, use law of large numbers to decide liability -> ALM
8. insurance companies often segement their general acconut asset into sub-portfolios with specific lines of business or liabilities,
   each with its own return objective
9. low pairwise correlations with other asset classes is not enough
10. rf_AO -> cash or asset that has low correlation with other assets
    rf_ALM -> asset that has high correlation with liability
    benchmark_ALM -> liability
11. to mimic the liability of DB plan
    inactive - inflation-hedged -> TIPS, not hedged -> nominal bonds
    active - accured -> TIPS or nominal bonds, future wage growth -> TIPS (inflation) + equities
12. pre-tax range -> a, tax rate -> t, after-tax range?
    higher tax rate -> higher transaction cost -> wider range -> a/(1-t)
13. range increase with higher cost, lower prob of deviation
    -> asset correlation (one rise, others may rise after a period of time -> less likely to deviate)
    -> illiquidity -> higher transaction cost
    -> belief in momentum, A rise, rebalancing requires to reduce the position, but you believe it would rise more 
                           A down, rebalacning requires to add the position, but you believe it would down more
14. when credit spreads are high -> corporate bond YTM are high -> corporate bond prices are low -> long corporate bond
    GDP growth ok -> equities will be ok
