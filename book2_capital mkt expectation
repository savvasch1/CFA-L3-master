Reading 10-11

1. challenges in forecasting
[1] limitations to economic data
    time lag/ revision/ rebase
[2] data measurement errors and biases
    survivorship bias/ appraisal data - under-estimated variance and correlation with other
[3] limitations of historical estimates
    non-stationary data comes from regime changes
[4] ex post risk is a biased risk measure of ex ante risk
[5] biases in analysts method
    data-mining/ time-period bias (specific period)
[6] failure to account for conditioning info
[7] misinterpretation of correlations
[8] psychological biases
[9] model uncertainty

2. analysis of economic growth
- exogenous shocks
  unanticipated, can cause regime changes
  can be caused by government policy/political event/technology/natural disaster/natural resources/GFC
  
3. decomposition of GDP growth
Y = A * K^alpha * L^beta (alpha + beta = 1)
A: total factor productivity
K: capital per worker
L: labor input

4. anchoring asset returns to trend growth
mkt value of equity V = GDP * (earnings/GDP) * PE
d_V% = d_GDP% + d_S% + d_PE% + d_dividend%

5. approaches to economic forecasting
[1] econometric modelling
    structural models / reduced-form models
    pros: many variables/ reusable models/ quantified
    cons: complex and time-consuming/ relationship can change/ open to interpretation
[2] economic indicators
    leading (monetary supply, PMI) / coincident (GDP)/ lagging (inflation)
    pros: simple and intuitive/ available
    cons: inconsistent indicators/ false signals
[3] checklist approach
    pros' opinion
    pros: less complex/ flexible
    cons: subjective/ time-consuming
    
6. business cycle
   output gap = potential GDP - actual GDP
   [1] initial recovery
   falling inflation, large output gap, bond yields bottom out, stock price rise
   [2] early expansion
   low inflation, bond yield rise a little, stock price rise
   [3] late expansion
   0 output gap, increasing inflation, bond yield rise, stock price peaks
   [4] slowdown
   increasing inflation, bond yield peaks (possible inverting yield curve), stock price falls
   inverting yield curve because of tightening monetary policy (rising short-term) and fisical policy (decrease long-term)
   [5] recession
   inflation peaks and falls, bond yield falls, stock price may rise in the end

7. monetary policy
goal - long-run sustainable growth - balance between growth and inflation
neutral rate - equilibrium interest rate = real-growth + inflation
Taylor rule
target = (real_neutral rate + inflation) + 
         0.5*(expected real growth - target real growth) + 
         0.5*(expected inflation - target inflation)
         
8. fiscal policy
tax and government spending
budget deficit = fiscal policy + business cycle
- on interest rate (after the policy has taken effect)
monetary affects inflation, fiscal affects real rate
loose monetary - 
inflation, loose fiscal - high real rates
- on yield curve (during the policy)
monetary affects short-term yield largely, fiscal affects long-term yield mildly
loose monetary - lower short-term yield, loose fiscal - high long-term rate

9. forecast risk and return
- sample stat
- shrinkage estimate (weighted between historical VAR and analyst VAR)
  same method in de-smoothing
  Rt = (1-lambda)rt_observed + rt_unobserved
  VAR(r) = (1+lambda/1-lambda)*VAR(R)
- time-series estimate (ARCH/GARCH)
  sigma_t = alpha*sigma_t-1 + beta*epsilon(unexpected component) + gamma
- multi-factor
  forecasting portfolio volatility (Barra risk model)
  sigma_i^2 = beta(i,m)*beta(i,n)*corr(m,n) (cov mat) + res_i^2
- DCF
- risk premium

10. forecast FI return
[1] DCF
may fail to achieve YTM
sell bond prior to maturity/ changing reinvestment return/ IH > MacDuration (reinvestment risk > price risk, not immunized)

[2] risk premium
r = rf + term premium + credit premium + liquidity premium
- term premium (positively related to duration)
  inflation uncertainty 
  recession hedge (demand-driven inflation:good/ supply-driven inflation:bad)
  supply and demand
  business cycle
- credit premium
  expected default loss
- liquidity premium

11. forecast equity return
[1] DCF - Grinold and Kroner 
originally, r = (D1/P0) + g
after revision, r = (D1/P0 - d%Shares) + d%Earnings + d%P/E
income return: dividend + sales (as repurchase)
earnings growth return: d%Earnings
repricing return: d%P/E

[2] risk premium - Singer-Terhaar model
originally, risk premium RP_i = beta(i,m)*RP_mkt
fully global, RP_(i,glb) = beta(i,glb)*RP_glb
fully segmented, RP_(i,sgm) = beta(i,sgm)*RP_sgm
                            = cor(i,sgm)*(std(i)/std(sgm))*RP_sgm
                            = std(i)*(RP_glb/std(glb))
combine, RP_i = phi*RP_(i,glb) + (1-phi)*RP_(i,sgm)

12. forecast real estate
higher quality properties are less cyclical
[1] DCF
P0 = NOI1(net operating income)/(r-g)
cap rate: NOI1/P0  or  r-g
r = (NOI1/P0) + g = cap rate + NOI growth rate
in finite period
r = cap rate + NOI growth rate - d%cap rate
(- d%cap rate) - capital gain, as P0 increase if cap rate decrease
cap rate - positively related to int rate (r-g) and vacancy (higher risk, higher discount rate)
           inversely related to availability of debt (P0) (lower int rate, lower r-g)

[2] risk premium
r = rf + term premium + credit premium + equity risk premium + liquidity premium

13. forecasting FX
affected by trade flows/ purchasing power parity/ current account and exchange rate
capital mobility
d%S(d,f) = (rd-rf) + (term_d - term_f) + (credit_d - credit_f) + (equity_d - equity_f) + (liquid_d - liquid_f)
         = (risk-premium defined) int rate_d - int rate_f
uncovered int rate parity (UIP)
d%S(d,f) = rf(d) - rf(f)

Note:
1. Y = A * K^alpha * L^beta (alpha + beta = 1)
   (Y/L) = A * (K/L)^alpha
   -> d(Y/L)/(Y/L) = dA/A + alpha * d(K/L)/(K/L)
   Y = (Y/L) * L
   -> dY/Y = d(Y/L)/(Y/L) + dL/L
   -> dY/Y = dA/A + dL/L + alpha * d(K/L)/(K/L)

alternative deduction
Y = A * K^alpha * L^(1-alpha)
logY = logA + alpha*logK + (1-alpha)*logL
     = logA + logL + alpha*log(K/L)
dlogY = dlogA + dlogL + alpha*dlog(K/L)
where dlogX = logX_t - logX_t-1 = log(X_t/X_t-1) = log(1+(X_t - X_t-1)/X_t-1) = (X_t - X_t-1)/X_t-1 = dX/X
-> dY/Y = dA/A + dL/L + alpha*d(K/L)/(K/L)

the same goes to mkt value of equity V = GDP * (earnings/GDP) * PE
dV/V = dGDP/GDP + d(earnings/GDP)/(earnings/GDP) + dPE/PE + dDiv/Div

2. monetary policy -> inflation / big impact on short-term rate
   fiscal policy -> real int rate/ small impact on long-term rate
   restrictive monetary policy + restrictive fiscal policy -> higher short-term + lower long-term -> inverted
   restrictive monetary policy + loose/stable fiscal policy -> higher short-term + higher/stable long-term -> flat
3. in business cycle, leading order: stock (money supply, PMI) -> economy (GDP->benchmark) -> bond -> inflation
   initial recovery: low or falling int rate, bond yields bottom out
   early expansion: rising int rate, stable or rising bond yields
   recession: inflations peaks, bond yields falls, stock price may rise in the end
4. risk premium RP_(i,glb) = beta(i, glb)*RP_glb
   (set cor(i,m)=1, you get seg)  RP_(i,sgm) = (std(i)/std(glb))*RP_glb
   RP_i = phi*RP_(i,glb) + (1-phi)*RP_(i,sgm)
   
   alternative
   RP = phi * beta_i * sigma_i * SharpeRatio_m + (1-phi) * sigma_i * SharpeRatio_m
   
5. Mac D. = modified D. * (1+YTM)
   when investment horizon>Mac D. -> reinvestment yield > fall in bond price -> a rise in bond yields will result in a return higher than YTM
6. for emerging mkt, signs of potential trouble
   deficit/GDP > 4%, debt/GDP > 70%, foreign debt/GDP > 50%
   real growth rate < 4%, current a/c deficit > 4%, foreign debt / current a/c > 200%, foreign exchange reserve/short-term debt < 100%
7. when estimating the risk premiums using equilibrium models
   (1) remove the impact of smoothing from the data (2) adjust for illiquidity using a liquidity premium
8. when sample size of sample VCV matrix > number of asset, you can do it. But to be proper, you need at least 10*number of asset
   best practice: use shrinkage estimation of the weighted averages of the sample and factor-based VCV matrices
9. The downward sloping yield curve indicates that the economy is likely to contract in the future
   In recessions, bonds outperform stocks because inflation and interest rates decrease and economic growth is slow
10. in real estate, lease ususally locks in longer terms, regardless of economic cycle
    -> in recession, lease remian, value goes down -> lease rate goes up
11. for stock -> r = d1/p0 + g = d1/p0 - d%S + d%Earnings + d%P/E
    for real estate -> r = cap rate + g = cap rate + d%NOI - d%cap rate (capital gain, cap rate decrease -> P0 increase)
12. high-frequency (daily) data -> subject to async problem (time-lag) -> lower correlation biases
13. prudence trap -> overly cautious in forecasts
    e.g. give more weight to historical data as a safety measure to manage client's expectations
14. indicators approach -> because relationship between inputs are not static, it has not consistently worked
    econometric approach -> cannot predict turning points, but can provide quantitative estimates of effect of exogenous variable
    checklist approach -> subjective
15. top-down approach -> needs historical data to find relations, therefore can be slow at detecting cyclical returns
                      -> more optimistic facing a recession compared with bottom-up
16. long-term government bond yield is directly linked to trend rate of growth in an economy
    equity capital gains (not dividend yield) is directly linked to GDP
17. projected long-term total domestic equity return = capital gains + dividend yield
    capital gains = d%nominal GDP + d%profits/GDP + d%PE
    nominal GDP growth = real GDP growth + inflation
    labor-based method GDP growth = employment + labour productivity
                                  = (growth in potential labour force + growth in labour force participation) + growth in labour productivity
                                  (labour productivity is a sub-component of total labour productivity)
    G-K on stock return = (D1/P0 - d%Shares) + d%Earnings + d%P/E
18. Dornbusch overshooting -> countries with higher investment return will attract capital with higher expectation, s.t. it will overshoot can depreciate a little in the end
    F/S = (1+r_dc)/(1+r_fc) -> quote in dc/fc
    F -> unbiased estimate of spot 
    (F-S)/S = (r_dc - r_fc)/(1+r_fc) = r_dc - r_fc
    r_dc here is not the risk-free rate of dc, 
    but r = rf + term premium + credit premium + equity risk premium + liquidity premium
19. when regressing GDP against labour and capital, the intercept is the total factor productivity
    when asked which factor has the greatest impact, multiply the beta with the actual growth rate of both labor and capital, and compare them with the intercept
20. H-model -> (D/r-g)*[(1+long-term g) + (N/2)*(short-term g - long-term g)]
    fed model -> forward earnings yield = long-term treasury yield. if >, then undervalued
21. high frequency data  are more sensitive to asynchronism across variables -> tend to produce lower correlation estimates
22. in GK model, r = d1/p0 + g = d1/p0 - d%S + d%Earnings + d%P/E -> if there is inflation data, add inflation to return
23. i* = rneutral + πe +0.5*(Ye–Ytrend) + 0.5* (πe– πtarget) (Add INFLATION!)
24. Var(r_portoflio) = {(1+λ)/(1- λ)}*var(R_proxy)
25. Expected return E(Re) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate (nominal) – %ΔCap rate
    d%Cap rate = (end CapRate - beg CapRate)/beg CapRate
