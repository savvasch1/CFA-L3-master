1. currency swaps
    [1] cross-currency basis swap
        - you need a loan in fx - you borrow local, then swap it with fx
        - principals switched at the begining, int pmt not netted
        - basis stands for financial cost for using swap
    [2] synthetic borrowing
        - you receice fx, change it into local - you swap it with local
        - no principals switched
        - swapRate_A = 3%, swapRate_B = 5% - NP_A * 3% = NP_B * 5%
    
2. currency forward and future 
    - you need to exchange currency A to B @ pre-specified rate
    - hedge ratio = amount of currency to be exchanged/future contract size

3. volatility derivatives
    VIX - implied volatility in S&P 500 for 30 days
    VIX return negatively correlates with equity return
    - VIX futures - cannot buy spot VIX, buy futures
    - variance swap
      fixed exchange for implied volatility^2
      settlement amt = notional variance * (sigma^2 - K^2)
      MtM variance valuation
      - expected variance = realized var*t/T + K^2*(T-t)/T  (time-wighted variance)
      - expected payoff = notional variance * (expected variance - K^2)
                        = notional variance * (Var_realized^2 - K^2) * t/T
      - discount with rf
  
4. other derivatives
    [1] fed funds futures
        contract price = 100 - expected FFE rate
    [2] eurodollar futures
        contract price = 100 - future int rate
    [3] CPI swaps
     
5. currency basics
    - MtM value of a forward
          @ maturity - Vt = (St - FP) * contract size
          @ t - Vt = (FPt - FP0)*contract size/(1 + rf*(days/360))
    - FX swap
          close the forward contract, open another one - roll forwards
    - return decompose
          r_FC - foreign-currency return
          r_FX - change in currency pair
          r_DC - return in domestic perspective

          r_DC = (1+r_FC)(1+r_FX) - 1
          on portfolio, r_DC = sum over wi*(1+r_FCi)*(1+r_FXi) - 1
    - variance decompose  (assume r_DC = r_FC + r_FX)
        var_DC = var_FC + var_FX + 2*sigma_FC*sigma_FX*correlation(FC, FX)
  
6. should you hedge FX risk?
    [1] no hedge
        mean-reverting fundamental values
        zero-sum game
        management and transaction cost
    [2] short-term: hedge, long-term: no hedge
        pricing inefficiencies in short term
        affected by international trade and capital flows in short term
        may be operated by central banks

7. IPS-related currency mgt are ignored

8. carry trade
    - borrow low-yield currencies and invest in high-yield currencies
    - covered int rate parity (CIRP)
      (F - S)/S = (i_P - i_B)/(1 + i_B) = i_P - i_B
      uncovered int rate parity (UIRP)
  
Note:
1. manager’s market views -> TAA
  correlation between asset and currency returns / investor’s time horizon, risk aversion, and liquidity needs -> SAA
2. EUR/KRW 0.00067/0.00068,  forward points –1.2/–1.1
   to long, 0.00068 - 1.1/100,000 (by the quote of 5-digit) -> 0.000669
   to short, 0.00067 - 1.2/100,000 -> 0.000658
3. R_dc = (1+R_fc) * (1+R_ret) - 1  -> do not use R_fc + R_ret
4. Currencies with higher relative interest rates tend to attract capital and appreciate in value
   Note that a common misconception is that the forward currency exchange rate is a valid predictor of what will happen to the value of a currency
5. gamma -> d_delta/d_S -> peaks @ ATM
6. a u.s. investor with euro stock
   to get rf_euro -> short euro futures
   to get rf_usd -> short euro futures and short euro forward
7. cross hedge -> underlying does not match
8. min variance hedge ratio -> euro stock return in terms of USD ~ b0 + b1*spot rate + epsilon
   where b1 -> MVHR -> cov(y,x)/var_y   -> riskier than one-on-one hedge as it is based on historical data
9. 1% change in volatility for a variance swap -> P&L vega notional
   variance notional = vega notional / 2*X
   mtm value = notional variance * (expected variance - K^2)
             = notional variance * (realized variance * t/T + K^2 * (T-t)/T - K^2)
             = notional variance * (realized variance * t/T - K^2 * t/T)
             = notional variance * (realized variance - K^2) * t/T
             -> payoff of a variance swap is convex to changes in volatility (volatility^2 = variance)
10. to long EUR/GBP -> if 1 EUR/GBP -> 1.1 EUR/GBP -> you take a profit when GBP ↑
    -> to long GBP
11. short a straddle -> short ATM call + short ATM put
    delta -> ATM option delta = 0.5 ->  +0.5 - 0.5 = 0
    gamma -> long = pos gamma  short = neg gamma (draw delta(-1~1) ~ stock price) -> - - = negative
    theta -> long = neg theta  short = pos theta -> + + = positive
    vega  -> long = pos vega   short = neg vega  -> - - = negative
12. volatility smile(skew) -> implied volatility (option value) ~ X
    -> left OTM put and ITM call  /   right OTM call and ITM put
13. currency overlay -> hire a currency expert while following the same IPS guildlines (they work together)
    separate asset allocation -> hire a currency expert while following different guildlines (they work separately)
14. to eliminate the potential basis risk -> exactly match the maturity (do not roll short-term or use long-term)
15. to completely hedge downside risk of JPY, the cost effective method using option of JPY/EUR would be 
    long ITM JPY put + short OTM JPY call -> long ITM JPY/EUR call + short OTM JPY/EUR put
16. to calculate the return of a long currency and a future position
    -> (END currency value - BGN currency value + P&L on future)/BGN currency value
17. factors that cause appreciation
    higher real rates/ healthy debt situation/ increase in trade surplus/ decline in trade deficit
18. to calculate the cash required to close out USD/EUR, 
    value * (forward_t - forward_0) / (1 + US Libor * t/360)
19. currency roll yield -> positive if sell @ premium or buy @ discount, + if sell depreciated or buy appreciated
20. non-deliverable forwards(NDFs) is cash settled and have smaller credit risk compared to outright forward,
    as no notional principle is exchanged at the maturity
21. to hedge two long foreign curreny position with high correlation, you directly hedge each one.
    The high correlation only help if you long one and short one, in that case you may use cross-hedge or MVHR
22. currency overlay will only add value if the currency alpha has a low correlation with domestic asset returns
