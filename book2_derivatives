Reading 15-16

1. option basics
- option value = intrinsic value + time value
  option value = f(S, X, T, rf, sigma), all can be almost certain except sigma, which is the core of pricing
- profits = payoff - premium
- synthetic asset
  forward = call -  put
  call = asset + put
  
2. option strategies
- covered call = asset - call
  expectation: stock will rise, but to a certain degree
  profit = (St - S0) - max(0, St-X) + c
  [1] yield enhancement
  short deep OTM call, collect premium
  [2] reduce position
  short ITM call, close in the near future
  [3] target price realization
  short OTM call, close in the future
  
- protective put = asset + put
  expectation: stock will rise, but do not want to lose
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, X-St) - p
  
- collar = asset - call + put
  profit = (St - S0) + max(0, Xp-St) - max(0, St-Xc) - p + c
  expectation: stock will rise, do not want to lose, but do not want to pay premium

- bull call = call_low - call high (reduce fee)
  bull put = - put_high + put_low (control risk)
  bear put = put_high - put_low (reduce fee)
  bear call = - call_low + call high (control risk)
  
- straddle = call + put @ same maturity and X

- calendar spread = long-term option - short-term option
  which longs the "forward volatility", as time value decays more in short-term than long-term

- by volatility
  high: long call/put
  low: short call/put
  mid: long and short call/put
  
3. greeks (option price change / ...)
[1] delta - underlying
    c = S*N(d1) - K*exp(-rT)*N(d2) 
    p = S*N(-d1) - K*exp(-rT)*N(-d2)
    delta_call = N(d1) ~ (0,1)
    delta_put = N(-d1) ~ (-1,0)
    draw option value ~ X, delta_OTM = 0, 1 = abs delta ITM
[2] vega > 0 - volatility
[3] rho - risk-free rate
    rho_call > 0
    rho_put < 0
[4] theta < 0 - passage of time
    except for deep ITM put
[5] gamma - delta ~ underlying
    draw option value ~ X
    call: delta from 0 to 1, put: from -1 to 0
    for both, gamma > 0, largest ATM
    
4. volatility smile
implied volatility ~ X
- foreign currency, symmetric smile
- equity, skewed to the right
  leverage/ volatility feedback/ crashphobia
  strategy: long options with high implied vol, short with low vol
  [1] OTM call - OTM put = long forward 
  [2] ITM put - ITM call = short forward
  

5. int rate derivatives
[1] int rate swap
    - duration of floating bond = reset period (*0.5)
      as the next pmt has been set, so the int rate will have full impact on single cf
    - duration_fix > duration_floating
      so duration_receiver = duration_fix - duration_float > 0
      
[2] forward rate agreement
    virtually borrow money at a pre-specified rate in the future
    long - floating (mkt) - X  (positively with int rate)

[3] short-term int rate (STIR) futures
    eurodollar futures - quotes 1 million @ 100 - annualized forward rate, ususally quarterly
    1bp -> 1 mil * 0.0001 * 90/360 = $25
    long - 100 - forward rate  (negatively with int rate)
    
[4] longer-dated FI futures
    underlying: hypothetical 30 yr T-bond with 6% coupon rate
    delivery: physical settlement, designated by shorter, CTD with maturity > 15 yrs
    to adjust duration, D_Target * P_portfolio = D_portfolio * P_portfolio + N * D_future * P_future
                        D_future = D_CTD / CF
                        N = (D_target - D_portfolio)/D_future  *  P_portfolio/P_future
                          = (DD_target - DD_portfolio)/DD_CTD  *  CF
                          
6. Equity derivatives
[1] equity swap
    receive equity return, pay fixed rate/ floating rate/ another equity return

[2] equtiy futures and forward
    to adjust beta, beta_target * P_portfolio = beta_portfolio * P_portflio + Nf * beta_future * P_future
                    P_future = index_future * multiplier
                    N = (beta_target-beta_portoflio)/beta_future  *  P_portoflio/(index_future*multipler)
    synthetic cash (beta_target=0) = stock - future
    synthetic equity (beta_portfolio=0) = risk-free + future
    
- Equity/bond transform 
  stock - (decrease beta) - cash - (add duration) - bond 

Note:
1. The more ITM is an option, the higher is its (absolute) delta (closer to 1)
   The more OTM is an option, the lower is its (absolute) delta (closer to 0)
2. for yield-enhancement purpose, do not take adverse position, and use OTM option
3. a short put is said to have a positive delta
4. the delta of a covered call -> delta of underlying - call >0
   the delta of a protective put -> delta of underlying + put >0
5. fix-rate duration -> 0.75 * T 
   floating-rate duration -> 0.5 * reset period
6. hedge ratio for Bond using future
   N = (D_t - D_p)/D_f  *  V_p/V_f
   N = (D_t - D_p)/(D_CTD/CF)  *  V_p/V_CTD
7. when fixed received increase (duration increase), cash flow risk goes down, mkt value risk goes up
8. a floating loan with a payer swapation, you do not commit(lock) @ X, you could end up with paying less when int rate goes down
9. when you try to increase the allocation of a bond, if you are given the duration of cash, use V_p*(D_p - D_cash)/D_futures*V_futures
10. to cancel a swap -> to enter a reverse swap or swapation (may not cancel)
11. if given the duration of cash, then the #futures needed
    (D_cash - D_p)*(V_target - V_p)/(D_future*V_future)
12. to adjust bond duration with future contract, use modified duration of future
13. a long straddle breakeven point is X - c - p or X + c + p, which has nothing to do with underlying asset price S0
14. with asset -> covered call, protective put, collar
    without asset -> straddle, bull/bear call/put spread
15. when adjust an asset allocation back to target, say Vbond0, Vstock0 -> Vbond1, Vstock0
    if adjust bond, it is (Vbond1 + Vstock0) * (Vbond0/Vbond0+Vstock0)
