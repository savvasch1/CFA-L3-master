Reading 18~19

1. Durations
[1] Macaulay duration
pv-weighted average repay period
[2] modified duration
1% change in yield - ? % change in price,  (d_p/p)/d_y
[3] effective duration
ex post facto, (pv_ + pv+)/(2*pv0*(r+ - r_))
[4] dollar duration
1 unit change in yield - ? dollar change in price, d_p/d_y
[5] dv01
1 bp change in yield - ? dollar change in price, 0.0001*dollar duration
[6] duration of portfolio (parallel shift)
Dp = w1D1 + w2D2
DDp = DD1 + DD2
[7] key rate duration (non-parallel shift)
KDRi = WiDi

2. factors affecting duration
- maturity, positive
- coupon rate, negative
- interest rate, negative (convexity)
- option, negative

3. convexity
- price ~ yield, negatively inverted to axies
  therefore, for certain d_y, prices goes higher than lower
- d_p = - D * d_y + (1/2) * Conv * (d_y)**2
- callable: part negative convexity - lower convexity over all -> cheaper
  putable: part higher convexity - higher convexity over all -> expensive

4. realized return
RR = coupon + coupon reinvestment (RI risk) + capital gain/loss (price risk)
when int rate up, coupon RI up, captial gain down

- to measure RI risk - investment horizon
          price risk - macaulay duration
if investment horizon > macaulay duration, higher RI risk, and vice versa

5. FI risk factors
primary:
- int rate risk
parallel shift in yield, measured by effective duraton
- yield curve risk
non-parallel shift in yield, measured by key rate duration
- spread risk
spread between treasuries and non-treasuries, measured by spread duration

non-primary:
- credit risk
- liquidity risk
- optionality risk

6. 3 bonds
laddered portfolio - averagely dispersed CF
bullet portfolio - concentrated CF
barbell portfolio - like a barbell

- higher dispersion(barbell>laddered>bullet) - higher convexity
- convexity = (Mac.D**2 + Mac.D + dispersionCF)/(1 + yieldCF)**2

7. 3 effects of FI
[1] diversification
- high-yield bond like t-bond during stress, like stock during boom
- when int rate volatility increase, near-term vol > average vol
[2] regular cash flow
- better for ALM, balance RI risk and price risk, build an immu portfolio to changes in int rate
[3] hedge for inflation (only for certain types)
- R_nominal = R_real + inflation rate
- fixed-coupon, unprotected
- floating-coupon, protected coupon, not but principal
- inflation-linked coupon 
  like TIPS (principal linked to inflation, coupon rate fixed)
  both principal and coupon are protected
  
8. ALM mandates
[1] duration matching - immunization
goal: FV_A = FV_L
conds: PV_A = PV_L and r_A = r_L (to lock an r_A)
       r_A = coupon (fixed) + coupon RI (float) + capital gain/loss (float)
       to offset the last 2 parts, D_A = D_L 
       therefore DD_A = DD_L
risks after immunization
- int rate risk,  convexity unhedged
- yield curve risk, above assume parallel shift
- rebalancing risk, if int rate change, D_A and D_L will change and may not have to be equal
  may result in liquidity risk and high portfolio turnover
- credit risk

[2] cash flow matching - all CFs matched precisely
backward propagation - match from the last CF
pros: easier, no parallel shift assumption, no rebalancing
cons: maturities(timing) may not match

[3] contingent immunization
when PV_A > PV_L, actively manage the surplus with AO

[4] horizon matching
for short term: use CF matching
for long term: use duration matching

9. AO mandates
benchmark: index
- passive - pure indexing
  copy risk factor
- semi-active - enhanced indexing
  match primary risk factor - duration (int rate risk, yield curve risk, and spread risk)
- active - alpha

10. bond liquidity
- government > corporate
  high credit > low credit
  frequent > non-frequent
  larger issues > smaller issues
  shorter-term > longer-term

- in pricing illiquid, use matrix pricing (linear interpolation)
- alternative ways to long illiquid FI - future, CDS, ETFs

11. return decompose
[1] yield income = (coupon + coupon RI)/p0
[2] rolldown return = (p1 - p0)/p0
    roll yield = yield income + rolldown return
[3] from change in int rate = -D*dy + 0.5*conv*dy**2
[4] expected loss = PD * LGD * EA
[5] currency gain/loss

12. leverage
- leveraged return rE = ((B+E)*rA - B*rB)/E = rA + B/E*(rA-rB)
- ways to leverage
[1] future contract
leverage = (notional value - margin)/margin
[2] swap agreement
floating-rate has smaller int rate risk than fix-rate, so duration_floating-rate < duration_fixed-rate
fixed rate payer = long floating + short fixed, duration < 0
fixed rate receiver = long fixed + short floating, duration > 0
[3] inverse floater
- (normal) floater = alpha * L + QM
  alpha<1, deleveraged  alpha>1, leveraged
- inverse floater = -alpha * L + QM
  short int rate
[4] repo
dollar interest = principal * repo rate * (term of repo days/360)
[5] short
- cons of leverage
risk of forced liquidation, even higher leverage, fire sale

13. tax
- only realized income are taxed
- tax of capital gain < tax of coupon
- tax-loss harvesting - capital loss can only cut tax on capital gain
- zero-coupon
  if held-to-maturity, coupon income tax
  if for trading purpose, capital gain tax 
- asset location among 3 a/cs
[1] taxable
[2] tax-exempt
[3] tax-deffered

14. types of liability
classify by certainty of amount and timing
[1] type I - known amount/timing
[2] type II - known amount/ unknown timing
    callable/putable bond, life insurance
[3] type III - known timing/ unknown amount
    floater, TIPS
[4] type IV - unknown amount/timing
    property insurance, DB plan

15. managing single liability
[1] int rate risk immu
buy a zero-coupon bond
- no RI risk, no price risk, but zero-coupon bond are not always available
[2] int rate immu
buy a coupon bond
- exposed to RI and price risk, to offset,  PV_A >= PV_L, and MacD_A = MacD_L
- for yield curve risk and int rate risk, to minimize convexity
  zero-coupon bond has no yield curve risk(curvature does not matter)
  low dispersion has low convexity, --  low yield curve risk
- asset convexity > liability convexity （涨多跌少）

16. derivatives overlay
DD_L = DD_A + DD_derivative
to increase duration, you can
[1] long futures [2] long fixed receiver [3] long fixed receiver swapation
- futures
DD_L = DD_A + N*DD_F
for T-bond, follow the cheapest-to-deliver principle, where P_CTD = P_F * conversion factor(CF)
DD_F = D_F * P_F = D_CTD * (P_CTD/CF) = DD_CTD/CF
- swap 
DD_L = DD_A + NP*DD_swap

- when int rates are low - expected to rise - P_A decrease - higher hedge ratio
- vice versa

17. AO
[1] passive
- mimic credit quality, types of borrowers, maturity, and duration
- consistent with EMH
- pros/cons: good diversification, full replication is not attainable
- other ways to replicate
  open-ended mutual fund
  ETF - more liquid than mutual fund
  total return swap -   index CFs - (LIBOR + spread)
[2] enhanced indexing
- mirror primary factors
- more flexible and efficient than passive
- stratified sampling
  process: identify primary characteristic, find similar bonds, choose the best among them
  enhance: lower cost, issue selection, yield curve, sector/quality, call exposure
  when int rate rise, more callable (cheap) / putable (safe) bond
  when int rate fall, less callable (unsafe) / putable (cheap) bond
- primary indexing
  int rate risk - effective duration
  yield curve risk - key rate duration (PVD - pv of distribution)
  spread risk - spread duration
  sector and quality
  optionality
  issuer exposure
[3] active
  
18. laddered bond portfolio
pros: diversified / modest convexity / liqudity mgt
cons: hard to build


Notes
1. strategies to manage taxable account
   - realize capital losses to offset capital gains
   - extending holding periods to realized long-term capital gains
   - consider differentials in income and gain tax
2. managing liability from lowest risk to highest risk (needs most cash to least)
   cash flow matching -> horizon matching -> immunization -> contingent immunization
3. convexity (涨多跌少) -> dispersion -> barbell -> putable
4. for a 5% per year liability, you need a security with both YTM and RI to be 5%
5. relative value in bond -> rank expected return by sectors, structures, issuers from mkt
6. execess return -> return_p - return_treasury with a set of key rate duration across the term structure
   expected return -> estimate future returns by decomposing historical patterns that are like to recur
7. (D_target - D_portfolio)*V_portfolio = N * D_future * V_future = N * (D_CTD/CF) * V_CTD
   BPV_target -  BPV_portoflio = N * BPV_future = N * (BPV_CTD/CF)
8. income risk is smaller in a portoflio with longer maturities
9. in inmmunization, aside from D_A = D_L, it requires PV_A >= PV_L, not r_A >= r_L
10. structure trade -> trade security with and without option
11. in yield maximization, total return approach is better than relative value
12. in AO, enhanced indexing uses the sampling method (stratified sampling to match primary risk factors), while pure bond indexing and active mgt do not
13. inmmunization needs rebalancing, even after one small parallel shift, or just after some time
14. cushion spread -> active mgt to generate returns - for an incremental difference between min acceptable return and higher immunized rate
15. spread duration is the key measure of relative sensitivity and tracking error
16. when int rate rise, callable bond (bond - call) will not execise the option, thus increasing the value
                        putable bond (bond + put) will execise the option, thus increasing the value
17. enhanced indexing -> try to earn back admin and other fees, if attain higher return than that, it is likely to be active mgt
18. to long convexity -> reduce exposure to callable and MBS (issuer's right), long putable (buyer's right), long call and put options (volatility ~ convexity)
19. positive (right) skewed return -> long tail @ right -> mean > median. 
    most investment in emerging mkts are negatively (left) skewed
20. methods of leverage to increase portfolio returns
    -> futures/ swaps/ structured financial instruments/ repos/ securities lending
21. zero replication -> D_A = D_L, s.t. the int rate risk has been immunized
22. investment-grade bond -> spread risk (credit rating migration, measured by spread duration) -> negative relation between credit spread and risk-free rate
    high-yield -> credit loss -> EL = PD * LGD
23. Z-spread > OAS -> callable/ Z-spread = OAS -> option-free/ Z-spread < OAS -> putable
    Z-spread is the benchmark, if you add less yield to match the benchmark, it means the bond is less valuable -> callable
24. roll-down strategy applies in a upward sloping, static yield curve. It rolls down (right to left) and sell bond at a lower yield
25. long MBS -> sell prepmt option (bet you will not call) -> sell convexity
26. bonds with option -> effective duration and effective convexity
    option-free bond -> modified duration and convexity
27. Immunization -> minimize the variance in the realized rate of return/ lock in the cash flow yield (internal rate of return) on the portfolio
28. immunize a single liability -> matched Mac Duration and minimize portfolio convexity
           multiple liabilities -> larger convexity than liability but minimized in order to minimize dispersion and reduce structural risk
29. to deal with one-time shift in yield curve -> match Mac Duration -> price effect cancel coupon reinvestment effect
30. DB plan is a form of type IV liability. timing (you don't know how long to pay) amonut (you don't know the wages before retirement)
31. In LDI, even if the liability is certain with timing and amount, is still affected by interest rate in the form of discount rate
32. if an outstanding bond can be retrived with a samll premium, there is no need to long a bond with duration/cash flow matching
33. Butterfly spread = – (Short-term yield) + (2 x Medium-term yield) – Long-term yield
34. effective duration can be used in evluating bonds with embeded options
35. Futures BPV = Note BPV / Conversion Factor
    Number of contracts = (Asset BPV – Liability BPV) / Futures BPV
36. bond market exposure -> A total return receiver swap would entitle the investor to receive the cash flows and compensation for the appreciation in the index 
                            in exchange for paying a floating rate plus a spread
