Reading 20-21

1. changes in yield curve
[1] parallel shift (level)
[2] slope
    spread = yield_long - yield_short
[3] curvature
    butterfly spread = 2 * yield_mid - yield_short - yield_long
- short-term rates are more volatile than long-term
  upward - flattens + less curved
  downward - steepens + more curved

2. strategy - stable yield curve
[1] buy and hold
    in a upward slope, extend maturity to have a higher expected return
[2] riding the yield curve
    in a upward slope, buy long-term and sell it later
                   or, short short-term and long long-term
[3] sell convexity
    if no expected change in yield curve, then convexity is useless
    short bonds with high convexity, long bonds with low convexity
    high: putable
    low: callable, MBS(can prepay)
[4] carry trade (buy duration)
    if no expected change in yield curve, then duration is no harm
    long a long-term bond with low financing cost (issuing a low-yield bond)
    buy bond with repo/ receive fixed, pay float/ long future

3. strategy - yield curve movement
[1] duration mgt
    decrease duration if int rate expected to rise
    increasee duration if int rate expected to fall
[2] buy convexity
    - 涨多跌少
    - methods (keeping duration-neutral)
      by pure bond - long high convexity bond, short low convexity bond
      by embedded option - long putable, short callable
      by portfolios - long barbell, short bullet
      by options - long call/put on bond
      call/put are both convex derivatives
      V_callable = V_pure - V_call
      V_putable = V_pure + V_put
[3] butterfly
    butterfly - long short and long(barbell), short middle(bullet)
    

4. changes - yield curve movement
[1] level change
    - choose the highest return
    total return = TYM_beg + delta_pricePer
    where duration = - delta_pricePer / delta_int
    so, total return = YTM_beg + [-ED_end * delta_int]
                     = YTM_beg + [-ED_end * (YTM_end - YTM_beg)]
                     = (yield income + rolldown return) + delta_pricePer
    - alter convexity
    by the methods above
[2] slope change
    - flattens (short term increase, long term remain or decrease)
      barbell outperforms bullet
      (short-term affects little, long-term remain the same, so barbell is hardly affected)
      so, long barbell, short bullet
    - stepeens (short term decrease, long term remain or increase)
      barbell underperforms bullet
      (basically the same as above, barbell is hardly affected in both case)
      so, long bullet, short barbell
[3] curvature change
    - more curvature
      barbell outperforms bullet
      (mid-term up -> bullet down, long-term down -> barbell up)
      so, long barbell, short bullet
    - less curvature
      barbell underperforms bullet
      (mid-term down -> bullet up, long-term up -> barbell down)
      so, long bullet, short barbell
[4] volatility change
    - volatility increase
      long convexity
    - volatility decrease
      short convexity

5. inter-mkt carry trade
[1] with currency risk
- borrow low int rate currency, lend high int rate currency
- currency swap, receive high int rate currency
- borrow low int rate currency, change into fx and invest, also sign a fx forward contract to repay later

[2] without currency risk
no fx risk because you borrow and invest in the same country, profit comes from yield curve steepness
- receive fixed (long-term) in steep mkt, receive floating (short-term) in flat mkt
- long future in steep mkt, short future in flat mkt

[3] covered int rate parity (CIRP)
invest in base = change into fx(on S) + invest in fx + change back to base(on F)
1 + r_DC = (F/S) * (1 + r_FC)
hedge benefit - comes from using F instead of S_t
(F - S)/S = (F/S) - 1 = r_DC - r_FC

hedged benefit = bond's local mkt return + hedge cost/benefit

6. credit risk
[1] risk decomposition
investment grade - more concerned about credit migration (downgrade) risk, int rate risk, spread risk
high-yield bond - more concerned about default risk

y_corporate = y_treasury + spread
int rate risk measured by d y_t,  - d p_c/d y_c
spread risk - d spread, - d p_c/ d y_c
for a junk bond, spread risk is much more concerned with than int rate risk (empirical duration)
as bond deteriorate from Aaa to Ccc, empirical duration gets smaller 

[2] quotes
investment-grade - spread over benchmark government bond (as you care more about spread risk)
high-yield - price terms (as the whole price may gone)

[3] credit spread
benchmark spread = yield on a credit security - yield on a benchmark bond with similar duration
- G-spread (government bond as benchmark)
  same maturity
- I-spread (swap rate as benchmark)
- Z-spread (like IRR)
- OAS (option-adjusted spread) 
  When a portfolio includes bonds with and without embedded options, market value weighted average OAS is the best measure of credit exposure

[4] excess return
- holding-period excess return
  XR = spread_beg*t + spread_duration*delta_spread
- expected excess return
  EXR = XR - expected loss(t*PD*LGD)
  
7. credit analysis approach
[1] bottom-up approach
    choose the best relative value from bonds with similar features
    - divide the credit universe
    - identify the best relative bond
      best means highest [expected excess return/credit risk (duration)] bond's sharpe ratio
[2] top-down approach
steps (1) macro factors
      (2) desired credit quality determination
          - credit cycle/ credit spread changes
      (3) assess the credit quality of portfolio
          - average credit rating (S&P over-estimate ratings)
          - average OAS
      (4) industry sector allocation
      (5) expected excess return
risks (1) int rate measurement and mgt
      (2) country and fx exposure
      (3) spread curve

8. others
[1] liqudity risk
- measures of secondary mkt liquidity risk
  trading vol./ spread sensitivity to fund outflows/ bid-ask spread
[2] tail risk
- portfolio diversification/ tail risk hedge
[3] international credit mkt
- credit cycle/ credit quality/ sector decomposition
- emerging mkt credit
  concentration in commodities and banking
  government ownership
  credit quality (sovereign ceiling)
[4] structured financial instruments
- MBS (mortgage)
  high liquidity/ less default risk/ exposure to real estate/ exposure to expcted changes in int rate volatility
- ABS (non-mortgage)
  more liquid/ diversification
- CDO (debt)
  senior/mezz/junior values change with correlation in default


Notes
1. short-term rates always change more than long-term rates (assume long-term remains) 
   -> short-term changes > 2*intermediate changes, however, short-term changes does not matter as its duration = almost 0
   so, when yield curve flattens (short-term rise) -> intermediate yields go up -> bullet price go down -> barbell outperforms bullet
       when yield curve sharpens (short-term down) -> intermediate yields go down -> bullet price go up -> bullet outperforms barbell
2. more curveture -> short-term and long-term down, mid-term up -> barbell outperforms bullet
3. module 20.5 -> If implied forward rates occur, all bonds will earn the same return over the forward period being analyzed
4. Expected return = yield income + rolldown return(natural price change assuming no change in yield curve) + E(change in price based on yield view)
5. a 10-year swap to pay the U.S. fixed rate is economically equivalent to shorting (or borrowing) at the 10-year U.S. rate
