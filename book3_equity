Reading 22-25

1. role of equity in a portfolio
capital appreciation/ dividend income/ diversification/ inflation hedge
negative screening/ positive screening/ thematic investing

2. equity universe
- by size and style
large/mid/small * value/blend/growth
con: size and style drift
- by location
developed/ emerging/ froniter
con: currency risk/ overestimation of diversification
- by economic activity
mkt-oriented/ production-oriented
con: hard to assgin big complex company to one sector
- by equity indices and benchmarks

3. income of equity
- capital appreciation (no or low tax)
- dividend (high tax)
- securities lending
- covered-call (stock - call) / cash-covered put (cash - put)
- dividend capture

4. cost of equity
- mgt fees + performance fees (high water marks)
- admin fees (custody/ depository/ registration)
- trading cost (explict + implict)
- investment strategy cost (momentum strategies - demand liqudity/ contrarian strategy - supply liquidity)

5. shareholder engagement
- corporate strategy/ capital allocation/ governance/ compensation/ board of directors
- cons: focus on short-term/ non-public info/ conflicts of interest

6. active or positive?
- confidence/ client preferences/ ESG
- risk for active mgt
  reputation risk/ key person risk/ higher portfolio turnover (tax burdens)
  
7. index
- rule-based/ transparent/ investable
- buffering (breakpoint)/ packeting (split between indices)
- determine the mkt exposure
  mkt segment/ capitalization/ style
- construct and maintain
  weighting: mkt-cap(liquidity)/ price/ equal/ fundamental
  rebalancing/ reconsitution
- stock concentration
  HHI = sum over w_i^2
  effective no. of stocks = 1/HHI 
  
8. vehicles for passive equity
- pooled investment
  ETF
- derivatives based
  to rebalance the portfolio using stock futures
  compeletion overlay(adjust beta)/ rebalancing overlay(adjust stock)/ currency overlay
  cons: basis risk/ position limits
- separately managed account

9. passive portfolio construction
- full replication
  U-shaped tracking error as no. of stocks increase = decreasing tracking error + increasinig trading cost
- stratified sampling
  sample by fundamental styles (exclusive and exhaustive)
- optimization
  factor-based replication: lowest tracking error
  tracking error is a trade-off between benefits of larger sample size and increased costs
- blended approach
- factor-based semi-active (smart beta)
  factor: growth-value/ size/ div yield/ momentum/ quality/ volatility
  alter certain factor exposures
  return-oriented: div yield, momentum
  risk-oriented: volatility-weighting, minimum-variance investing
  diversfication-oriented: equal-weighting, max-diversification weighting
  
10. active strategies
[1] top down - CME/ asset class
[2] bottom up - fundamental
- value based
relative value/ contrarian investing/ income (divdend) investing/ high-quality value
deep-value (low PE/distressed) investing/ restructuring and distressed debt/ special situations
- growth based
GARP (growth at a reasonable price)/ PEG (PE to growth)
[3] factor-based
- long/short
rewarded/unreward factor - q10 - q1
cons: nonlinear relation cannot be detected/ middel q overlooked/ exposure to other factors
- factor timing
equity style rotation
[4] others
- activist (minimal shareholder engagement)
- statistical arbitrage
- mkt microstructure
- pairs trading
- event-driven

11. style classification
[1] holdings-based
morningstar style box (size*value)
cons: style definitions may vary
[2] return-based
return of portfolio ~ indices
cons: extreme styles/ style drfit

12. source of active returns
rewarded factors / mispricing / idiosyncratic risk
Ra = sum over (beta_p - beta_b)*factor + alpha + epsilon
- building blocks of construction
  factor weighting + alpha skills + sizing positions
- fundamental law of active mgt
  E(Ra) = IC * sqrt(BR) * active risk * TC(transfer coef)
  
13. active share and risk
- active risk (tracking error)
  = sigma_factor + sigma_alpha
- active share (share deviation)
  = 1/2 * sum over |wgt_p,i - wgt_b,i|
- low to high
  pure indexing / closet indexing / factor-neutral&diversified stock picks / diversified factor bets / 
  concentrated factor bets / concentrated stock picks
  
14. risk budgeting
- absolute measure
  var_p = sum over w_i * w_j * cov_i,j
- relative measure
  TE_p = sum over (w_i - b_i) * (w_j - b_j) * Rcov_i,j
  
15. considerations in equity portfolio
- leverage
  R_geometric = R_arithmetic - sigma^2/2
- AUM / portfolio turnover&investment horizons / mkt impact 
- slippage
  time delay/mkt impact
  empirical studies: slippage higher than explicit/ higher in small-cap/ higher during high mkt volatility

16. what is a well-constructed portfolio
- can achieve desired risk exposures with fewer positions
- for similar risk factor exposures, have lower absolute/relative risk/ higher active share

17. long-only v. long-short
- gross exposure = long + short
  net exposure = long - short
- long extension portfolio = long 130 + short 30
- mkt neutral portfolio (pairs trading)
- short squeeze
  stock lender may require higher margin/collateral


Notes
1. ESG constraints -> active mgt, narrowly defined benchmark -> passive mgt
2. pro of derivative -> quick, efficient, cheap, liquid
   con of derivative -> have to roll over, position limit, not flexible, counterparty risk, basis risk
3. pro of ETF -> cheap and efficient than mutual open fund, reduce taxable gains and losses to existing holders
   con of ETF -> trading cost, bid-ask spread
4. relative value -> low P/E compare to sector-average
5. replication of an index
   full replication -> liquid, small #stock
   stratified sampling -> no obvious con
   (factor-based) optimization -> based on historical relations, do not work if factors are uncorrelated?
6. construction of an index
   value-weighted -> biased toward large stock, minimize tracking error, self-rebalancing, minimal rebalancing cost
   equal-weighted -> biased toward small stock
7. concern about growth / value
   growth -> P = EPS * P/E -> 1. EPS less than expected, 2. P/E contract -> Davis double click (kill)
   value -> undervaluation will not correct
8. Investors are more likely to be willing to pay higher fees for higher Active Share as an indicator of greater active management.
   Not active risk.
9. diversified multi-factor approach -> low single-security risk (1%), modest overall portfolio risk, flexibility on sector risk
   stock-picking -> high active risk, high exposure to risk from a single security, low sector deviations
   sector rotation -> high active risk, high tolerance for sector deviations
10. risk-efficient -> lowest active risk using fewer securities and higher active share
11. when you add a fund to a bigger portfolio, high covariance with the fund may increase the total volatility but likely decrease the active risk
12. passive factor-based strategies tend to be transparent in terms of factor selection, weighting, and rebalancing, can be easily copied
    relative to boark-mkt-cap-weighting, it tend to concentrate risk exposures
13. large tracking error stems from -> smaller number of stocks/ delay in reinvesting dividends/ less frequently rebalancing or reconstituting
14. buffering -> as long as stocks remain in the buffer zone, they stay in the current index -> #holdings > #index
    reconstituting -> delete names that are not longer in and adding names approved
    packeting -> if a mid-cap stock's cap increase above the breakpoint between the mid-cap/large-cap, it is split into 2
15. in calculating a portfolio's risk and return characteritics
    return-related -> sum over w_i * return_i
    risk-related (variance, tracking error) -> (sum over (w_i * risk_i)**2)**0.5
16. buy-and-hold outperforms rebalancing strategy in an upward trending market.
    buy-and-hold is not for conservative risk profile 
17. core-satellite differs from alpha beta separation in that the satellite also carrys beta
18. a fund provides exposure to the factors of size, value and quality -> have different mkt cap, P/E, debt-to-equity from benchmark (index)
19. Private real estate funds typically report details on all properties owned, making it more transparent than hedge funds
