Reading 26-27
1. Hedge Funds
- key features
  low regulatory constraints/ flexible mandates/ aggressive exposure/ larger investment universe
  free use of leverage/ liquidity constaints/ higher costs/ lock-up period/ notice period

2. Equity 
[1] long/short - (net long pos)
    specialist L/S managers (sector-specific focus)
    generalist L/S managers
    
[2] (dedicated) short bias - (net short pos)
    dedicated short-selling (only short)
    short-biased (mostly short)
    active short selling (muddy waters mode)

[3] equity mkt neutral 
    pairs trading (long/short 2 stocks)
    stub trading (long/short parent/son company)
    multi-class trading (long/short bond/stock of same company)
by leverage: short bias < long/short < equity mkt neutral

3. event-driven 
[1] soft-catalyst
    make investments when event has not happened
[2] hard-catalyst
    make investments upon event
- merger arbitrage
  [1] cash-for-stock
  Acquiring company buy target company with cash
  - so you should long T
  [2] stock-for-stock
  Acquiring company buy target company with stock
  - so you should long T and short A
- distressed scurities
  bad competiveness/high leverage/poor governance/fraud and irregularities

4. relative-value (FI)
[1] fixed-income arbitrage
    duration/ credit quality/ liquidity/ optionality
    yield curve trade - long/short @ different points on yield curve, to bet on curve flattening or steepening
    carry trade - long high yield and short low yield, e.g. on/off-the-run
[2] convertible bond arbitrage
    long convertible bond, short stocks - convertible bond goes more like stock than bond
    
5. opportunistic
[1] global macro -> discretionary
top-down, bet on macro things like exchange rate, central bank policy
[2] managed futures -> systematic
time-series momentum /cross-sectional momentum
- both have high leverage/volatility/liquidity/ right-tailed return/ low correlation with mkt

6. specialist
[1] volatility trading (by option)
time-zone arbitrage (same underlying, different countries)
cross-asset arbitrage (macro-oriented ?)
[2] reinsurance / life settlements
    - low surrender value/ low premium pmts/ high prob of people die
    
7. multi-manager 
[1] FOF
    diversification/ small investments/ low tail risk/ high mgt fee/ high leverage
[2] multi-strategy
    low mgt fee/ efficient TAA/ transparent/ high op risk/ high tail risk

8. conditional factor risk model (like barra)
return of HF ~ alpha + risk factor + dummy variable (0 if normal, 1 if distress) + error
- risk factor
  equity risk/ currency risk/ credit risk/ volatility risk(VIX)/ liquidity risk
- risk measure
  [1] sharpe ratio/ sortino ratio (downside risk)
  good: managed futures/ equity mkt netural/ global macro/ event-driven
  not so good: fof/ multi-strategy (diversification effect overvalued)
  [2] standard deviation
  good: short-biased/ mkt neutral/ managed future/ fof
  not so good: event-driven/ relative value
  [3] drawdown
  good: global macro/ managed futures/ merger arbitrage/ mkt neutral
  not so good: LS/ event-driven/ relative value
  
9. roles of alternatives
- capital growth/ income generation/ risk diversification/ safety
- diversification
  apprisal value are often used in alternatives, so diversification may be over-estimated
  
10. investment opportunity set
[1] traditional approach
- by liqudity
  FI: cash - bond - private equity
  equity: public - equity HF - private equity
  other: commodity - REIT - private real estate - private real asset
- by economy/inflation
  bad/deflation: non-indexed bond (FI)
  bad/high inflation: indexed bond/ gold
  good/moderate inflation: equity and private credit
  good/high inflation: commodities/ real estate
- pros
  easy to interpret
- cons
  over-estimation of diversification
[2] risk-factor approach
- private equity = public equity
  private credit = public high-yield bond
- pros
  risk-factor identification/ integrated framework
- cons
  use of historical data - time lag
  
11. considerations
[1] risk
- option-like pattern because of illiquidity and valuation
  so, we cannot assume normally-distributed return
- unable to achieve the target weight because of illiquidity
[2] expected return
- limited validity of data - smoothing
[3] vehicles
- limited partnership - LP + GP
- SMA (separately managed accounts)
- open-ended mutual funds
[4] liqudiity
- drawdown structure
  calldown period - distribution period - termination
[5] expense and fees
- HF - mgt fee@AUM, incentive fee@each year, high-water, hurdle
- PE - mgt fee@committed capital, incentive fee@termination
[6] tax
[7] in-house programs (build)
    intermediaries (buy)
    
12. asset allocation
- to avoid normality assumption in alternatives
  [1] empirically observed returns
  [2] model a fat-tailed distribution
- models
  [1] monte carlo (by risk factors)
  [2] optimization (mean-variance)
  [3] risk factor based optimization
  
13. liquidity planning
[1] maintain the desired allocation
NAV_t = NAV_t-1 * (1 + growth rate) + contribution_t - distribution_t
contribution_t = rate of contribution_t * (capital commitment - paid-in capital)
distribution_t = rate of distribution_t * (NAV_t-1 * (1 + growth rate))

[2] handle capital calls
invest in liquid securities

[3] plan for the unexpected
do stress-test

14. monitoring
- key persons/ interest aligned with investors' interest/ style drift/ risk mgt/ client and asset turnover

15. evaluation
IRR - affected by the timing of CFs
MOIC(multiple on invested capital) - (NAV + distribution)/total invested capital

Note:
1. long bias means net long position overall
2. Assets that are not subject to a fundâ€™s redemption terms are said to be held in a side pocket
   A gate is a maximum amount an investor may redeem at one time
   A lock-up is a restriction on redemptions during a period of time
3. asset valuations for many alternative investments are based on appraisals, returns data are likely to be artificially smoothed and are often stale
   If serial correlation is present, statistical techniques exist that can be used to unsmooth the data
   relatively short history of alternative investments, which may result in small-sample and time-period biases
   One method for modeling a distribution with fat tails (positive excess kurtosis) is to define risk and return properties for two or more distinct market environments, 
   for example, a normal period and a high-volatility period. Returns for each of these can be described with a normal distribution with its own assumed mean and variance, 
   Combining the distributions, using an assumed probability of each environment occurring, results in a non-normal distribution.
4. to achieve a target allocation to alternative investments, an investor needs to account for the expected growth rate of the portfolio
5. Because some alternative investments have relatively short histories of returns data, 
   use of historical data (even unsmoothed data) alone may introduce time-period and small-sample biases
6. right-tail return/ right-tailed skewness -> crisis alpha, performs good when bad economy
7. in CFA, equity or distressed debt is not thought to have specific inflation-hedging function
8. drawback of risk-factor based approach: risk factors may change, and the model is sensitive to inputs
   drawback of traditional MVO: over-estimation of diversification effect
9. custom index proxy is unlikely to have the same risk-return characteritic of actual investment
   providers of peer group benchmark use very different construction rules
10. due to the high correlation between private equity and public-traded equities, the diversification effect is limited
    you can expect higher returns from the portfolio
11. clawback provison -> in private equity, to return incentive fees from profitable investment sold earlier and if later investment sold at a loss
12. limited partnership are used in hedge fund and managed futures 
13. benefits of fof -> selection skill/ diversification (not useful if you have a lot of money)/ access to closed funds (that fof has invested)
14. mgt fees in PE often scales down in later years to reflect a lower workload as the fund becomes fully invested
15. for distress debt -> overstated sharpe ratio because of the stale valuation/ high due diligence cost/ liquidity risk greater than mkt risk
