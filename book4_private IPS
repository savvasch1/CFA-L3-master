- unplanned goals (timing or amount cannot be esimated)
  property repairs/ medical expenses
[3] private client risk tolerance
- risk tolerance (willingness)
  reflected by: past investment/ emotion/ self-assessment
- risk capacity (ability)

[4] technical and soft skills for wealth managers


2. return calculation
[1] next year's return and maintain real value of investment
    CF needs / TIA (total investable asset) + inflation
    assumptions:
    - salary/expense happens at the end of period
    - current portfolio can be cashed without cost
    - all TIA and expenses are after-tax
    - living expense and intuition often account for inflation
[2] return for next 10 years
    IRR
[3] similar to [1], but TIA is in the future
    - you may have to estimate the return of the current portfolio

3. investment planning
[1] capital sufficiency analysis
- straight-line
  assume a deterministic growth
  con: unrealistic w.r.t variability in future outcomes
- MCS
[2] retirement planning
- mortality table
- annuities
- MCS
- biases
  consumption gaps: retirees spend less than expected
  annuity puzzle: individuals tend not to invest in annuities

4. IPS
[1] background and investment objectives
    detailed and quantified objectives
[2] investment parameters
    risk tolerance and capacity/ time horizon/ asset class preference
    liquidity preference - short-term gap (inflow - outflow)
[3] portfolio asset allocation
    SAA + TAA
[4] portfolio mgt
    - discretionary authority (full discretion - trade without approval)
    - rebalancing (time-based/ threshold-based)
    - tactical changes
    - implementation (third-parth money managers/ proprietary investment)
[5] duties and responsibilities
    - IPS review (at least annually)
[6] IPS Appendix
    - modeled portfolio behavior
    - capital mkt expectations
 
5. portfolio construction and monitoring
[1] portfolio construction

[2] portfolio reporting and review
    portfolio reporting/ portfolio review
[3] evaluating the success of an investment program
    - goal achievement
    meet long-term objective with an acceptable amount of risk
    - process consistency
    good recommendation for third-party manager/ follow the prescribed process for rebalancing/ reduce cost
    - portfolio performance
    better than benchmark
    - definitions of success
    pre-agreed criteria

6. ethical and compliance consideration
- fiduciary duty and suitability
- KYC
- confidentiality
- conflicts of interest

7. private client segments
[1] mass affluent segment (0.25 - 1mil)
    not customize
[2] high-net-worth (1 - 50 mil)
    customized investment mgt, tax planning, wealth transfer issues
[3] ultra-high-net-worth (>50 mil)
    multi-generational time horizons, complext tax, estate planing, anything
[4] robo-advisors (<0.25mil)

8. tax calculation
[1] simple tax
- accrual taxation (every year on income)
  FV = (1 + r - r*t)^n = (1+r*(1-t))^n
  tax drag = (FV_pt - FV_at)/(FV_pt - I_0) - reduction in return due to tax on capital gain
  - tax drag > tax rate  (compounded tax)
  - tax drag increase as investment horizon increase
  - tax drag increase as investment return increase
- deferred capital gain (one-time on gain)
  FV = (1+r)^n - ((1+r)^n - 1)*t
     = (1+r)^n*(1-t) + t
  tax drag = ((1+r)^n - 1)*t
  - tax drag = tax rate
  when you bought sth from past, and it cost B instead of 1
  FV = (1+r)^n - ((1+r)^n - 1)*t - (1-B)*t
     = (1+r)^n*(1-t) + B*t
- wealth-based (every year on wealth)
  FV = [(1+r)(1-t)]^n
  - tax drag > tax rate
  - tax drag increase as investment horizion increase
  - tax drag$ increase, tax drag% decrease as investment return increase
[2] blended tax
return on a portfolio can be divided into: interest + dividend + realized capital gain(RCG) + unrealized capital gain(UCG)
UCG of which can be deferred, int + div + rcg + ucg = 100% (total return)

return after realized tax R_art = r*(1 - int*t_int - div*t_div - rcg*t_cg)
effective capital gain tax rate on ucg t_ecg * [1- int*t_int - div*t_div - rcg*t_cg] = t_cg * ucg
FV = (1+r_art)^n - ((1+r_art)^n-1)*t_ecg - (1-B)*t_cg

[3] accrual equivlent tax rate (t_ae) and return (r_ae)
r_ae = r_pt*(1-t_ae)

9. types of investment accounts
[1] taxable account
    after-(ordinary) tax in, taxed during trading
    FV = (1+r*(1-t))^n
[2] tax-deferred account
    before-(ordinary) tax in, taxed @ withdraw
    FV = (1+r)^n * (1 - t_withdrawn)
[3] tax-exempt account
    after-(ordinary) tax in, no tax during or withdraw
    FV = (1+r)^n
    
10. tax alpha
[1] tax location
put equity in taxable (stock's capital gain are inherently tax-deferred), put bond in tax-deferred (int happend every year)
[2] time period mgt
capital gain tax rate =17% if horizon<1 yr, 7% of horizon>1 yr
[3] tax loss harvesting
realize unrealized loss, to lower tax
[4] HIFO
sell the security with highest cost

11. estate planning
testator -> testment (will) -> beneficiary
[1] probate - legal process to comfirm the validity of the will
to avoid the probate
- joint ownership/ living trusts/ retirement plans/ insurance policy
[2] ownership right
- forced heirship rules/ community property rights/ separate property rights
[3] core capital
pv of future liabilities of the family (using risk-free rate)
core capital + surplus = total asset
[4] monte carlo simulation
probaility of ruin (hazard rate) - spending is unsustainable

[5] relative after-tax values
RV = FV_gift/FV_bequest
A -> B
- if the gift if tax-free
  RV = [1 + r_b*(1-t_b)]^n / [1 + r_a*(1-t_a)]^n * (1-t_estate)
- if the gift is taxable
  RV = (1-t_gift) * [1 + r_b*(1-t_b)]^n / [1 + r_a*(1-t_a)]^n * (1-t_estate)
- if the gift is taxable and A pays the tax
  RV = (1-t_gift + t_gift*t_estate) * [1 + r_b*(1-t_b)]^n / [1 + r_a*(1-t_a)]^n * (1-t_estate)
  where the t_gift*t_estate is a tax sheild, as you have less asset as estate
- if B is a charity
  no gift tax, t_b=0, and tax shield
  
[6] estate planning strategies
- generational skipping
- spouse exemption
- valuation discounts (liquidity and minority)
- trust
  settlor/grantor -> trustee -> beneficiary
  revocable - ownership -> settlor  ->  tax on settlor
  inrevocable - ownership -> beneficiary   ->  tax on beneficiary  ->  protect claim
  fixed trust -> fixed amount/timing
  discretionary trust -> decided by trustee
  spendthrift trust -> to unable or unwilling to manage the asset
- life insurance
  lower tax/ beneficiary could be a trust

[7] tax jurisdiction
- source jurisdiction/ residence jurisdiciton
- residence-source conflict
  principle: source first, residence provides tax benefit
  - credit method
  max(T_source, T_residence)
  - exemption method
  T_source
  - deduction method
  T_source + (1 - T_source)*T_residence

12. concentrated single-asset position
- mostly public stock, private equity, and real estate
[1] objectives
- risk reduction/ increase liquidity/ maximize after-tax return
[2] constraints
- mandated to hold shares/ voting control/ retain growth potential/ illiquid/ big immediate tax/ legal/ margin lending rules
[3] psy bias
- cognitive: conservatism/ confirmation/ illusion of control/ anchoring and adjustment/ availability
- emotional: overconfidence and familiarity/ status quo/ naive extrapolation of past returns/ endowment effect/ loyalty effects
[4] estate tax freezing (transfer wealth while not losing control)
- recapitalization - split shares into voting preferred shares(hold) + non-voting common shares(transfer)
[5] techniques for public stocks
- outright sales
- monetization strategies (stock lending to produce liquidity)
  hedge to increase load-to-value ratio
  short sale/ total return equity swap/ short forward/ long put, short call
- hedging 
  protective puts/ a pair of puts/ knock-out put/ collar/ prepaid variable forwards (PVF) = short forward + loan
- yield enhancement
  long stock + short call (covered calls)
- tax-optimization
  index tracking with active tax mgt (take loan to buy index)
  completeness portfolio (long low cor. stock)
- cross hedge
  short a security or a basket of securities with high cor.
  short a borad or targeted index
  long put
- exchange fund
[6] techniques for private equity
- sell to strategic buyers/ PE/ mgt/ family member/ divestiture
- recapitalization - staged exit
  pro: provide liquidity/ lower risk/ retain incentives
  con: lose control/ 
[7] techniques for real estate
- mortgage financing
- charitably inclined
- sale and leaseback
  
13. risk mgt for individuals
[1] net worth/wealth
    net worth = assets - liability
    net wealth (enonomic net worth) = net worth + human capital (pv of wages) + pv of pension (unvested) - pv of consumption - pv of bequest
[2] implementation
    high freq, high severity -> risk avoidance
    high freq, low severity -> risk reduction
    low freq, high severity -> risk transfer (insurance)
    low freq, low severity -> risk retention
[3] risk exposures
    earnings risk (insure with disability insurance)
    premature death risk (insure with life insurance)
    longevity risk (insure with annuities)
    property risk (insure with property insurance)
    liability risk - with third party (insure with liability insurance)
    health risk (insure with health insurance)
[4] insurance
    types
    - life
      death: term/whole, participating/non-participating (with/without dividend)
      annuity: immediate/deferred, fixed/variable
      univerisal: insurance/investment accounts
    - non-life
    elements
    policy owner -> insured -> beneficiary
    elimination/waiting period - 180 days
    non-forfeiture clause -> cash value -> premium - net premium (f(coverage, mortality risk))
    guaranteed insurability -> flat premium for life
    gross premium = net premium + expense + profit + cash value
[5] annuities
    inflation concerns - all to owner
    payout method - joint life, period-certain annuity (fixed x years), life annuity with period certrain (at least x years), life annuity with refund
    annuity benefit taxation 

Note:
1. A possible explanation for retirees preferring to spend investment income rather than liquidate securities is that retirees consider this a self-control mechanism
2. The success of an investment program should be evaluated in terms of goal achievement, process consistency, and portfolio performance
   failure to meet up with benchmark is considered failure in goal achievement
3. ask I.D. like passport or bank a/c details is not considered a matter of confidentiality, but a requirement of KYC
4. common progressive tax regime, with a surprise, provides favorable tax treatment for int, div and cg, like flag and light
5. tax consideration, in the favor of passive investors -> active investors -> traders
6. core capital -> use MCS/ disconut future real needs @ real rf/ discount future nominal needs @ nominal rf
7. charitable gift of appreciated securities -> avoid gift transfer taxes + take an income tax deduction 
8. short sale against the box -> shorting the company stock that you own
9. exchange fund -> exchange concentrated share with others who also own concentrated shares
10. prepaid variable forward (PVFs) -> like collar -> own 1000 shares @ 50, lend @ X = 45, if S_t<50, deliver, if S_t>50, deliver less shares
11. level premium -> same premium for each year, annual premium -> different premium for each year.  
    Usually level premium charges higher, as the insurance company bears more risk
12. Net payment cost index -> the individual dies at the end of the horizon and cash value is not considered
    Net surrender cost index -> the individual terminates the policy (insurance ceases) at the end of the horizon and the cash value is received
13. need for life insurance -> highest human capital (career development)
14. motality table -> past experience and future projections
15. investment constraints for private clients -> time horizon, portfolio scale (or size), and tax planning. Does not include risk tolerance
16. vested pension value -> traditional BS  unvested pension value -> economic BS
17. HC = f(prob(survival), wage growth rate, rf + HC risk premium)
18. life insurance -> mortality risk (loss of HC)  /   annuities -> longevity risk
19. irrevocable trust can not only protect claims to settlor, but also to beneficiary to some extent
20. to avoid probate -> joint ownership/ trust/ life insurance
    will/testment does not avoid probate
21. wealth tax -> accumlated each year, t_wealth * cost basis * T_year
               -> paid each year, (1+r)^n - [(1+r)(1-t_wealth)]^n
22. R_ae(accural equivlent) = (FV/PV)^(1/n) - 1
    T_ae = 1 - R_ae/R_pt
23. primary capital = personal (residence, CDs, cash) + mkt (equity and bond). secondary = aspirational (concentraded positions)
24. sale and lease back with rent payable immediately -> price - (price - cost)*T_cg - rent + rent * T_income
25. mismatch in character -> tax mismatch
    e.g. on collars -> premium received -> income, premium paid -> later as deduction when realizing capital gains
    or different tax types -> on capital gain and income
26. flat and heavy tax regime -> flat -> on salary,  heavy -> on dividend and capital gains.  so int-paying asset is better
27. MVO can consider taxable and tax-exempt together, R_tax = R_exp*(1-t) -> sigma_tax = sigma_exp*(1-t)
28. death benefit are tax-exempt in most countries
29. probaility of ruin -> spend all money
30. consider wage growth rate and discount rate together, adjusted discount rate = (1+discount rate)/(1+growth rate) - 1
31. to calculate insurance needs
    -> 1. needs method -> total expense discounted - current coverage
    -> 2. human life method -> (future earnings - expenses) discounted - current coverage
