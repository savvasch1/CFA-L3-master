1. framework change
old framework RRTTLLU
new framework SLLERIA = RRTTLLU + stakeholder + asset allocation

2. common characterstic
[1] scale
[2] long-term investment horizon
    low liquidity needs: pension/ swf/ endowments and foundations
    adequacy of capital(LDI): bank and insurers
[3] governance framework
    board of directors set up investment committe, who writes IPS
[4] regulatory framework
[5] principal-agent issues

3. invesment approaches
[1] Norway model (swf)
    60% equity + 40% bond
    passive investments, low tracking error
[2] Endowment model (yale university endowment)
    high alternatives exposure, active mgt and outsourcing
[3] Canada model (pension)
    high alternatives exposure, active mgt and internally managed
[4] LDI model (bank and insurers)
    duration-matched, fixed-income exposure. some stocks
    
4. pension
DB
contract-defined pmts/ employer as major contributor/ third-party makes investment/ employer bears the risk/ pooled mortality risk
[1] stakeholders
    plan sponsors (employers)/ plan beneficiaries(employees and retirees)/ investment committee
    governments/ shareholders
[2] time horizon
    - liability
    to estimate the liability, assumptions include growth rate of salaries/ expected vesting/ mortality
    funded ratio = fair value of plan assets/ PBO (pv of defined benefit obligation)
    factors increasing liability: years worked/ salary/ longevity/ additional contributions
    factors decreasing liability: employee turnover/ expected investment return/ discount rate
    - investment horizon
    ratio of active employee and retirees
[3] liability
[4] risk
    - plan funded status 
    - sponsor financial status and profitability
    - correlation of profitability and investment
    - plan features (early retirement/ lump sum distribution)
    - workforce characteristics (age of workforce/ active v. retired)
[5] objective
    - primary objective
      meet pension liabilities
      fully funded - return on asset = actuarial discount rate
      underfunded - return on asset > actuarial discount rate (you have to make higher return to meet deficit/ or make additional contributions)
    - secondary objective
      minimize pv of expected cash contributions
[6] liquidity needs
    active v. retired/ age of workforce/ funded status/ withdraw when switch jobs
DC: pmts based on performance/ employee as major contributor/ employee makes investment/ employee bears the risk/ individual mortality risk
[1] stakeholders
    plan sponsors (employers)/ plan beneficiaries(employees and retirees)/ board/ governments
[2] liabilities and investment horizon
    liabilities = required contribution
    due to rise to scale and long-term horizon, DC plan may invest in PE or HF
    life-cycle (target-date) options
    - participant-switching options
      switch to more conservative asset allocation as aging
    - participant/cohort(群体) options
      offer different portfolio according to different retirement dates
[3] objective
    prudently grow assets to support spending needs in retirement
    can be in-house/ externally  or  passive/ actively
[4] liqudity
    age of workforce

5. sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)
5 types
- budget stabilization funds
  insulate budget from commodity price volatility (Chile/Russia)
- development funds
  allocate resources to priority infrastructure (Iran/UAE)
- savings funds
  share wealth across generations by transforming non-renewable assets (Temasek/Qatar/Kuwait/Russia)
- reserve funds
  reduce negative carry costs of holding reserves (China/Singapore)
- pension reserve funds
  pension-related contingent-type liabilities (China/Aussie/Kiwi)
[1] stakeholders
citizens/ investment offices/ board/ governments
[2] liability and time horizon
budget stab - uncertain liabilities and short horizon 
dev - not clearly defined liabilities
saving - long-term
reserve - long-term
pension - long-term
[3] liqudity
from low to high: saving dev reserve budget   (pension depends on accumulation or decummulaton)
[4] external
tax exempt
[5] risk
varies
[6] objective
budget sub - capital perservation/ try to outperform inflation rate/ low correlation with government revenues
dev - raise long-term economic growth
saving - real return objective/ long-term gov. budget
reserve - higher return on FX reserves to reduce negative carry cost
pension - meet future unfunded pension
[7] asset allocation
budget stab - fixed income and cash
dev - infrastructure project
saving - equities and alternatives
reserve - lower alternatives due to potentially liquidity needs
pension - based on accumulation or decumulation

6. endowments
[1] stakeholders
students, alumni, university employees
[2] liabilities and investment horizon
perpetual horizon
liabilities - future payouts promised, presented in spending policy, with smoothing payouts
liabilities factors: fundraising (you may have a lower spending rate when there is incoming donation)
                     reliance of the university on spending/ capacity of university to issue debt
Spending rule (usually between 4%~6%)
spending_t+1 = w*spending_t*(1+inflation) + (1-w)*spending_rate*average_AUM
w=1 - constant growth rule
w=0 - (avg) mkt value rule
[3] liquidity - annual spending - incoming gifts and donations
[4] external - tax exempt
[5] risk - high risk tolerance
[6] objective
    return = spending rate + inflation(HEPI) + mgt fee
[7] asset allocation
    yale endowment model (>50% to alternatives)
    
7. private foundations
types
commuinity - like endowment (no spending rate)
operating - set up to fund non-profit
corporate 
private grant-making - min 5% spending rate + flow through (spend all the donations of that year)
[1] stakeholders
    doners, recipients, community, government, board
[2] liabilities and investment horizon
    typically perpetutal, there is trend toward limited-life foundations (spending rate + flow through) 
[3] liquidity
    near-term liquidity + capital call + margin call
[4] objective
    real return - spending + inflation(CPI) + investment expense
[5] risk
    lower risk tolerance due to higher liqudity requirements
[6] external
    tax-exempt when meet min spending rule
[7] asset allocation
    long-term objective beating inflation

8. banks
[1] stakeholders - shareholders, customers, empolyee
[2] liabilities and investment horizon
    demand deposits/ term deposits
    long-term illiquid assets, short-term liquid liabilities
[3] liquidity - liquidity mgt is core
..
[6] external - reg: capital adequacy, liquidity, leverage   tax: taxable   systematically important financial institutions(SIFIs)

9. insurers
types: life insurers / property and casualty insurers
       publicly listed company/ mutual company(相互宝)
general a/c - life insurance and annuity policies - LDI
separate a/c - variable life policies(投资连结险) - mostly in equities
[1] stakeholders
[2] liabilities and horizon
    life insurers - 20-40 yrs
    P&C insurers - shorter duration and higher uncertainty
[3] liquidity
    internal liquidity (cash from operations and investment) and external liquidity (ability to borrow in debt mkt)
    in times of high interest rates, contracts with historically low-yielding contracts may cash in
    general a/c = reserve portfolio + surplus portfolio

10. bal. sheet mgt
[1] A = L + E   dA = dL + dE
    dE/E = dA/E - dL/E = (dA/A)*(A/E) - (dL/L)*(A/E - 1)
[2] - assume dy - yield on asset, di - yield on liability
      dE/ E*dy = (dA/ A*dy)*(A/E) - (dL/ L*di)*(di/dy)*(A/E - 1)
    - duration: dP/P = -D*dy, which measures the sensitivity of the price change of an asset to its yield change
      so D = -dP/P*dy
    - DurationE = DurationA*(A/E) - DurationL*(di/dy)*(A/E - 1)
    - duration of equity ~ degree of leverage, duration of asset and liability, sensitivity of changes in yields of asset and liability
[3] if you see equity as a portfolio of asset and liability
    wA = A/E, wL = L/E = 1 - A/E = - (A/E - 1)
    then the volatility of percent changes in the mkt value of equity
    sigma2_dE/E = sigma2_dA/A * (A/E)^2 + sigma2_dL/L * (A/E-1)^2 - 2*(A/E)*(A/E - 1)*cor*sigma_dA/A*sigma_dE/E
    so, to lower the volatilityE, you need to reduce volatility of asset and equity, to increase the cor of asset and liability (ALM)

11. managing liquidity risk
methods
[1] liquidity profiling and time-to-cash table
    threshold: 1 week - 1 quarter - 0.5 year - 1 year
[2] rebalancing and commitments
    systematic rebalancing - calendar/percent-range 
    automatic rebalancing - use liquid public asset to replace illiquid private asset
[3] stress testing
    historical/ statistical/ scenario
[4] derivatives
illiquidity premium = expected return on illiquid asset - expected return on marketable asset of same characteristic

Note:
1. Despite some smaller asset classes or strategies to be inaccessible due to capacity issues for institutional investors
generally, the larger scale of institutional clients opens up more asset classes (e.g., private equity and real estate) that are not generally available to individual investors
2. foundations and endowment have long term horizon, despite the liquidity needs
3. maximizing sharpe Ratio is contradicting to LDI or ALM, as maximize sharpe ratio is an action of AO
