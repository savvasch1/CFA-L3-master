Reading 35-36
1. components of performance evaluation
performance measurement / performance attribution / performance appraisal

2. attributions
[1] return-based
- use the total portfolio return
- easiest and least accurate

[2] holding-based
- calculate the HPR of each stock
- more accurate than return-based, do not consider turnover (transaction cost ignored)

[3] transaction-based
- consider both holding and transaction
- most accurate and time-consuming

3. approaches to attribution
[1] arithmetic attribution
    alpha = return - benchmark
[2] geometric attribution
    (1+alpha)*(1+benchmark) = 1+return (multiple periods)
 
 4. attribution for equity
 [1] the Brinson Model
 alpha = selection effect + allocation effect + interaction effect
       = w_b(r-b) + (w-w_b)b + (w-w_b)(r-b)
 [2] carhart 4-factor model
 rp - rf ~ alpha + rm-rf + smb + hml + wml + e
 factor tilt return = factor sensitivity difference * factor return 
 
 5. attribution for FI
 [1] exposure decomposition - duration-based
 - government/corporate * long/middle/short
 - alpha = int rate allocation + sector allocation + bond selection
   int rate allocation = duration effect + curve effect
           
 [2] yield curve decomposition - duration-based
 - alpha = yield + roll + shift + slope + curvature + credit spread + specific
 
 [3] yield curve decomposition - full pricing-based
 - repricing based on spot rates, most complex and precise
 
 6. risk attribution
 bottom-up/top-down/factor-based * relative/absolute
 
 7. benchmarks
 specified in advance/appropriate/measureable/unambigous/reflective of current opinion/accountable/investable
 [1] absolute return
     simple but not investable
 [2] broad mkt index
     manager's style may deviate from the index style
 [3] style index (recommended)
     differing definitions of style
 [4] factor-model-based 
     not intuitive and investable
 [5] return-based 
     factors are style indexes, so it is investable
     not work if manager changes style (new data incorporated takes a small portion)
 [6] manager universe (median)
     not investable or specified in advance, also subject to survivorship bias
 [7] custom 
     expensive and complex to build
 
 8. benchmarking alternatives
 [1] liquidity - appraisal and smoothing
 [2] transparency - self reported
     prone to survivorship bias and backfill bias
 [3] leverage 
 
 9. performance appraisal 
 [1] sharpe ratio - you assume indifferent upside and downside volatility
 [2] sortino ratio - measure downside risk
 [3] treynor ratio - measure systematic risk
 [4] info ratio - measure tracking error
 [5] appraisal ratio - Jensen's alpha/residual risk
     J's alpha = rp - rp_capm
     error of  - rp ~ alpha + rm + error  (unsystematic risk)
 [6] capture ratio - measure convexity of return
     upside capture (UC) = Rp/Rb when Rb>0
     downside capture (DC) = Rp/Rb when Rb<0
     capture ratio (CR) = UC/DC
     CR>1 convex (涨多跌少)
 [7] max drawdown
 
10. manager selection process
[1] manager universe
    IPS-based universe
    hiring a bad manager is type I error, rejecting a good manager is type II error
[2] qualitative analysis
    - style analysis
      return-based (RBSA) - regression using historical data
      holding-based (HBSA) - using current data
    - due diligence
      investment philosophy/ investment personnel/ decision-making process/ operational due diligence
[3] quantitative analysis
    - performance-based fees
      symmetrical structure: base + sharing of performance
      bonus fully exposed to upside: max (base, base + sharing of positive performance)
      bonus not fully: max (base, base + sharing of postive performance, upper limit)
      
Note:
1. Performance appraisal = performance measurement + performance attribution 
   -> determines whether the performance was affected primarily by investment decisions, by the overall market, or by chance
2. return = M(mkt) + S(style alpha) + A(alpha)
   style alpha = benchmark - mkt
   alpha = portfolio return - benchmark
3. capture ratio = Rp/Rb (when Rb>0) / Rp/Rb (when Rb<0)
4. to measusre evaluate hedge fund, 
   -> long/short may cause initial mkt value to be 0, rendering it difficult to calculatet the return
   -> hard to find benchmark, may use factor-based method and historical data
   -> the unsysmetric return distribution makes it inappropriate to use sharpe ratio (which prefer symmetric return distribution), could use sortino ratio
5. window dressing -> Value-based funds heavily position small-cap stocks and adjust positions during the reporting period, pretending to be value-> holding-based 
6. return-based -> regressed on style indexes, easier to implement (the attribution) than holding-based because of the data, is less accurate than holding based
