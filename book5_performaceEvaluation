Reading 35-36
1. components of performance evaluation
    performance measurement / performance attribution / performance appraisal

2. attributions
    [1] return-based
        - use the total portfolio return
        - easiest and least accurate

    [2] holding-based
        - calculate the holding period return of each stock
        - more accurate than return-based, do not consider turnover (transaction cost ignored)

    [3] transaction-based
        - consider both holding and transaction
        - most accurate and time-consuming

3. approaches to attribution
    [1] arithmetic attribution
        alpha = return - benchmark
    [2] geometric attribution
        (1+alpha)*(1+benchmark) = 1+return (multiple periods)
 
 4. attribution for equity
    [1] the Brinson Model **There are 2 Brinson models in the curriculum!
        alpha = selection effect + allocation effect + interaction effect
            = delta_R*W  + delta_W*R + delta_R * delta_W
    [2] carhart 4-factor model
        rp - rf = alpha + rm-rf + smb + hml + wml + e
        factor tilt return = factor sensitivity difference * factor return 
 
 5. attribution for FI
    [1] exposure decomposition - duration-based
        - government/corporate * long/middle/short
        - alpha = int rate allocation + sector allocation + bond selection
           int rate allocation = duration effect + curve effect
            
 [2] yield curve decomposition - duration-based
    - alpha = yield + roll + shift + slope + curvature + credit spread + specific
 
 [3] yield curve decomposition - full pricing-based
    - repricing based on spot rates, most complex and precise
 
 6. risk attribution
    bottom-up/top-down/factor-based * relative/absolute
 
 7. benchmarks
    SAMURAI
    specified in advance/appropriate/measurable/unambiguous/reflective of current opinion/accountable/investable
    [1] absolute return
        simple but not investable
    [2] broad mkt index
        manager's style may deviate from the index style
    [3] style index (recommended)
        differing definitions of style
    [4] factor-model-based 
        not intuitive and investable
    [5] return-based 
        factors are style indexes, so it is investable
        not work if manager changes style (new data incorporated takes a small portion)
    [6] manager universe (median)
        not investable or specified in advance, also subject to survivorship bias
    [7] custom 
        expensive and complex to build
    
 8. benchmarking alternatives
    [1] liquidity - appraisal and smoothing
    [2] transparency - self reported
        prone to survivorship bias and backfill bias
    [3] leverage 
 
 9. performance appraisal (SKILL OR LUCK) 
    [1] sharpe ratio - you assume indifferent upside and downside volatility - divide by sigma
    [2] sortino ratio - measure downside risk - divide by downside deviation
    [3] treynor ratio - measure systematic risk - divide by beta
    [4] info ratio - measure tracking error: active return / active risk
    [5] appraisal ratio - Jensen's alpha/residual risk
        J's alpha = rp - rp_capm
        error of  - rp ~ alpha + rm + error  (unsystematic risk)
    [6] capture ratio - measure convexity of return
        upside capture (UC) = Rp/Rb when Rb>0
        downside capture (DC) = Rp/Rb when Rb<0
        capture ratio (CR) = UC/DC
        CR>1 convex (always making money)
    [7] max drawdown
 
10. manager selection process
    [1] manager universe
        IPS-based universe
        hiring a bad manager is type I error, rejecting a good manager is type II error
    [2] qualitative analysis
        - style analysis
            return-based (RBSA) - regression using historical data
            holding-based (HBSA) - using current data, subject to window dressing
        - due diligence
            investment philosophy/ investment personnel/ decision-making process/ operational due diligence
    [3] quantitative analysis
        - performance-based fees
            symmetrical structure: base + sharing of performance
            bonus fully exposed to upside: max (base, base + sharing of positive performance)
            bonus not fully: max (base, base + sharing of positive performance, upper limit)
      
Note:
1. Performance appraisal = performance measurement + performance attribution 
   -> determines whether the performance was affected primarily by investment decisions, by the overall market, or by chance
2. return = M(mkt) + S(style alpha) + A(alpha)
   style alpha = benchmark - mkt
   alpha = portfolio return - benchmark
3. capture ratio = Rp/Rb (when Rb>0) / Rp/Rb (when Rb<0)
4. to measure evaluate hedge fund, 
   -> long/short may cause initial mkt value to be 0, rendering it difficult to calculate the return
   -> hard to find benchmark, may use factor-based method and historical data
   -> the unsymetric return distribution makes it inappropriate to use sharpe ratio (which prefer symmetric return distribution), could use sortino ratio
5. window dressing -> Value-based funds heavily position small-cap stocks and adjust positions during the reporting period, pretending to be value-> holding-based 
6. return-based -> regressed on style indexes, easier to implement (the attribution) than holding-based because of the data, is less accurate than holding based
