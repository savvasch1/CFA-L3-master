Reading 34

1. motivations to trade
[1] profit seeking
- trade urgency/alpha decay
[2] risk mgt/hedging
[3] cash flow needs 
- to minimize cash drag, use equitization (long futures to gain stock exposure)
[4] corporate actions

2. inputs
[1] order characteristic
- side/ size/ relative size
[2] security characteristic
- security type/ short-term alpha/ price volatility
[3] mkt condition
- liquidity crises
- volatility and liquidity are negatively related
[4] trading cost risk aversion
- high risk aversion - shorter horizon - greater urgency
[5] mkt impact and execution risk
- trader's dilemma
  if you trade fast, high price impact
               slow, high execution risk (adverse mkt movement)
               
3. reference price
[1] pre-trade benchmarks 
- decision price/ prev close/ open (no overnight risk)/ arrival risk (latest)
[2] intraday benchmarks
- vwap
  rebalance over the day, have both buy and sell orders
- twap
  exclude potential trade outliers
[3] post-trade benchmarks
- close
  to minimize tracking error
[4] price target benchmarks
- self-defined
  support and resistance

4. trading strategies
- short-term alpha - high urgency
- long-term alpha - low urgency
- risk rebalance
- client redemption (cash outflow)
- new client mandate (cash inflow)

5. trade implementation choice
[1] higher-touch approach (with human)
- principal trade  (dealer)
- agency trade (broker)
- OTC/ RFQ(request for quotes -> mostly used in illiquid mkt, e.g. fixed-income)
[2] low-touch approach (automated)
- alternatice tradinig systems (ATS)
  non-exchange
- direct mkt access (DMA) 
  for derivatices and currency
- dark pools

6. algo trading
[1] execution algo - to reduce trading cost
    - scheduled POV (percent of volume) 
      pro: can automatically take advantage of increased liqudity
      con: higher trading cost/ may not complete
    - scheduled VWAP 
      time_slicing: based on estimated trading volume distribution by hour
      u-shape (high volume in open and close)
    - scheduled TWAP (equal-weighted time schedule)
      pro: time-slicing schedule: equal volume
      con: not take advantage of liqudity condition
    - liquidity seeking
      trade faster @ favorable price
    - arrival price
      trade close to latest price, large amount at first
    - dark pools
    - smart order routers (SORs)
      highest probability of executing/best mkt price / small trade
[2] profit-seeking algo- to get alpha

7. comparison of mkts
[1] equity
large order - high-touch (human) / small order - low-touch (electronic)
urgent order - dealer / non-urgent order - broker
[2] FI 
traded in a bilateral, dealer-centric mkt structure, mostly high-touch
[3] derivatives - exchange
large urgent - sweep the book/ large non-urgent - electronic
small - direct mkt access (DMA)
[4] derivatives - OTC
high-touch, dealer for urgent, broker for non-urgent
[5] spot FX
large urgent - dealer (RFQ), large non-urgent - broker
samll - direct mkt access (DMA)

8. trade cost measurement
implmentation shortfall IS = paper return(relative to close) - actual return
both paper and actual return are -1+close/price_t

IS = execution cost + opportunity cost + fees
execution cost = (exec price - decision price)*exec volume
opportunity cost = (close - decision price)*(decision volume - exec volume)
execution cost = delay cost + trading cost 
               = (arrival - decision) + (exec - arrival)
9. trade evaluation
- cost in dollar per share
  (exec price - ref price) * side
- cost in total dollar
  (exec price - ref price) * side * shares
- cost in basis point
  (exec price - ref price)/decision * side * 10000bps
4 benchmarks for ref price
  arrival price/ vwap/ twap/ close
  
- mkt-adjusted cost
  to separate the trading cost due to mkt movement
  mkt-adjusted cost(bps) = arrival cost - beta * index cost
  arrival cost = (exec - arrival)/arrival * side * 10000bps
  index cost = (index vwap - index arrival price)/index arrival price * side * 10000bps

- added value
  to compare the arrival cost with estimated pre-trade cost
  added value = arrival cost - est. pre-trade cost
  
10. trade governance
- best order execution is a tradeoff among
  execution price/ trading cost/ speed/ likelihood of settlement/ order size
- process to monitor execution arrangements
  checkpoints / trading records/ regular reviews

Note:
1. increased liquidity can decrease mkt impact and execution risk
   -> execution risk is the adverse price movement in the time it takes to execute an order, more liquid mkt takes less time to execute
2. IS and mkt-adjusted cost in basis is compared to decision price * decision share
3. primary formula to calculate IS -> paper return - actual return
   where paper return (close - decision price) * decision volume
         actual return (close - exec) * exec volume - commissions
4. decision price -> prev close by default.  has nothing to do with limit order you placed
5. trade choice
   dealer -> large, urgent
   broker -> large, non-urgent
   OTC/ RFQ(request for quotes -> mostly used in illiquid mkt, e.g. fixed-income
   ATS/MTF -> non-exchange, privacy
   DMA -> small, buy-side（专线）, exchange-traded derivatives
   dark pool -> relatively large, non-urgent, illiquid, not need to fulfill all orders, privacy
   scheduled (POV VWAP TWAP) -> relatively small, non-urgent (not concerned about adverse mkt movement), relatively liquid
   arrival price -> urgent, risk-averse, relatively liquid, relatively small or medium
   SORs -> small, urgent, monitor lit and dark mkt
6. IS = paper return - actual return
      = (close - decision)#total - (close - exec)#fulfil + commission#fulfill
      = close#unfulfill + exec#fulfil - decision#total + commission#fulfill
      = (close - decision)#unfulfil + (exec - decision + commission)#fulfill
      = (close - decision)#unfulfill + (exec - arrival)#fulfill + (arrival - decision)#fulfill + commission#fulfill
      = opportunity cost             + execution cost           + arrival cost                 + fee
7. trading cost = execution cost = (exec - arrival)#fulfill -> use detailed order by order data if given
