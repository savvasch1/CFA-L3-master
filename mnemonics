Make sure you know these formulas:

    Grinold Kroner
        Change in the value of Equity = Div Yield + (%Delta_EPS - %Delta_new_Shares) + %Delta_PE

    Singer Terhaar
        1*sigma_*world_sharpe_ratio + rho_sigma_sharpe_ratio
        where rho is the integration coefficient

        4 prices:S_decision S_Arrival S_Execution S_T
        
        IS = paper return - actual return
        paper return = #shares_wanted * (S_T - S_decision)
        actual return= #shares_bought * (S_T - S_Execution) - fees
        
        
        three costs
        opportunity cost= (#shares_wanted - #shares_bought) * (S_T - S_0)
        fees = #shares_bought * fee per share
        
        execution cost
        delay: #shares_bought * ( S_Arrival - S_delay)
        trading= #shares_bought * (S_execution - S_arrival)
    
    Taylor rule
    target = (real_neutral rate + inflation) + 
             0.5*(expected real growth - target real growth) + 
             0.5*(expected inflation - target inflation)
    
    Real Estate prediction
    r = cap rate + NOI growth rate - d%cap rate
        why negative? (- d%cap rate) - capital gain, as P0 increase if cap rate decrease
        cap rate - positively related to int rate (r-g) and vacancy (higher risk, higher discount rate)
                   inversely related to availability of debt (P0) (lower int rate, lower r-g)
           
           
    Bond return calculation
        yield income + rolling return = 
        current yield + rolldown yield + changes due to yield curve change - expected losses +- FX gains

    Sortino/Sharpe/Information Ratio
        treynor = divide by beta
        sortino = divide by downside deviation
        information ratio = active return/active risk
        appraisal ratio = alpha/non systematic risk
        
    information coefficient (higher is better)
        E(R} = information_coefficient * sqrt(breadth) * sigma * Transfer coefficient
        
    Variance/Vega notional
        if they give you VEGA NOTIONAL in the exam you have to divide by 2K
        e.g. 
            normal:     payoff = N*(sigma^2 - K^2)
            adjusted:   payodd = N_vega / 2K *(sigma^2 - K^2)
