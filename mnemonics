        Change in the value of Equity = Div Yield + (%Delta_EPS - %Delta_new_Shares) + %Delta_PE

    Singer Terhaar
        1*sigma_*world_sharpe_ratio + rho_sigma_sharpe_ratio
        where rho is the integration coefficient

        IS = paper return - actual return
        paper return = #shares_wanted * (S_T - S_decision)
        actual return= #shares_bought * (S_T - S_Execution) - fees
        
        
        three costs
        opportunity cost= (#shares_wanted - #shares_bought) * (S_T - S_0)
        fees = #shares_bought * fee per share
        
        execution cost
        delay: #shares_bought * ( S_Arrival - S_delay)
        trading= #shares_bought * (S_execution - S_arrival)
