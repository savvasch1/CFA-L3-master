Behavioral finance
0. when given the name of bias to decide client's possible action, place more weight in the meaning of bias than which category it belongs to
   e.g. people with availability bias are harder to change, despite it is a cognitive error
1. heurstics/rule of thumb -> when you do something from hearsay or easy rule
2. herding -> actions often caused by regret aversion
3. state a cognitive bias to belief perservance (RICCH) or information-processing (FAMA)
4. to overcome behavioral bias -> seek contrary viewpoints/ look for new info/ do not rely on past/ use Bayes' theorem to incorporate new info


Economics
1. permanent income hypothesis 
   consumer spending is based on long-term predictions of income, short-term deviations (GDP decrease) does not affect the spending
2. G-K model (alternative)
   d%Y = d%A + alpha*d%K + (1-alpha)*d%L
   A -> total factor productivity / K -> growth in capital stock / L -> growth in labor input
   alpha -> output elasticity of capital / 1-alpha -> output elasticity of labor
3. factors may positively affect inflation
   consumer confidence index / inventory/sales / GDP output gap (actual GDP - potential GDP)/potential GDP
   
Individual
1. life-insurance, trust and charity can reduce total estate, resulting in a lower future estate tax
2. factors that increase ability to take risk
   -> long horizon(10 yrs or longer)/ stable income and expense (net savers)/ mortgage-free house/ fully vested pension plan
   factors that decrease ability to take risk
   -> short horizon/ concentrated position/ reduced human capital (disability)/ donation (or other cash outflow)/ small asset base
   with passage of time, factors that may have changed
   -> shorter horizon/ larger asset base/ accomplished cash outflow
3. accural equivalent tax rate
   -> calculate after-tax return r_at = (FV_at/PV) xexp (1/T) - 1
   -> calculate equivalent tax rate ->  T_ae = 1 - (r_at/r_pt)
4. tax liability = tax base * tax rate
5. pay attention to the timing of cash flow (coming year, then inflation not considered) 
                and the nature of cash flow (if it is taxable)
6. IPS for time-horizon 
   long/short, how many stages
7. IPS for uniqueness
   personal investment outside advisor-managed portfolio
8. shortfall risk = pre-tax nominal return - 2*nominal standard deviation
9. CFA calculator can input PV and PMT
10. pro of MCS -> simulate the probaility of distribution, allowing the client to determine the likelihood of accomplishing his goals
                  can consider multi-period effect of tax changes (if there is any)
    con of MCS -> does not reflect expection/ long period data subject to regime changes
11. conversion from DB to DC shifts risk to employees, therefore increasing their longevity risk
12. mortgage financing. net proceeds =  asset value * LTV
13. a retired man does not need disability insurance
    a rich man with no dependents or testamentary intentions does not need life insurance
14. establish a collar/ sell a forward/ buy a put will not eliminate the whole mkt risk, so it would not trigger tax
15. you have 3 mil, can gift or estate, both @ 50% tax
    if gift can you pay tax -> gift 2 mil, tax 1 mil
    if estate -> total 3 min, tax 1.5 mil



Institutional
1. factors that increase ability to take risk
   for foundations or endowment, goals like funding a project or meet min spending rate, are just goals, not binding requirement
2. liquidity requirement decrease the ability to take risk and require higher cash reverse, despite it would reduce return
3. a hire freeze or decrease minimum retirement age would shorten the investment horizon
4. fewer people in a pension plan would increase the liability noise, because acturial model follows law of large numbers
5. when comparing projects to take, take the one with lower required rate of return, giving it some cushion for volatilies in return or other variables (inflation)
6. a general spending rate can take more risks than a specific purpose
7. to manage liquidity risk
   -> liquidity profiling and time-to-cash tables/ rebalancing and commitment strategies/ stress testing analyses/ derivatives


Asset allocation
1. to ALM or not to ALM
   to -> fix-amt considered as liability
   not to -> floting-amt(5%) not considered as liability/ willingness to operate in perpetuity by investing in higher return
2. to MCS or MVO
   to MCS -> multi-period framework considering a lot of variables
             rebalacning policy can be incorporated
             non-normal distribution properties like skewness can incorporated

Equity
1. to full replication or to stratified sampling
   if the benchmark has high liquidity and low number of stocks (IH) -> better to use full replication
2. approaches to portfolio construction
   systematic/discretionary * top-down/bottom-up
   systematic -> diverisified portfolio/ large subset of securities examined
   discretionary -> concentrated portfolio/ small subset of securities examined/ greater depth of understanding company fundamentals
   top-down -> start with macro/sector
   bottom-up -> start with company-specific factors and investment style
3. a efficient portfolio can be [1] efficient in performance -> higher sharpe ratio
                                [2] risk exposures that align with investor expectation
                                [3] low idiosyncratic risk relative to total risk
                                [4] achieve a good replication of an index (low tracking error) with fewer stocks


Trading and evaluation
1. IS in bps = (paper return - actual return)%total value in initiation
2. opportunistic strategy -> less urgent, large order compared to daily volume
   IS -> urgent, regardless of the relative order size
   vwap -> less urgent, small order compared to daily volume
3. holding-based -> appropriate when holding info is not available with sufficient frequency
                    low accuracy/ vunlerable to data manipulation
   return-based -> appropriate when investment with low turnover/ extensive data with shorter time intervals
                   fail to capture impact of transactions/ may not reconcile to actual portfolio return
4. sortino ratio = (R_p - minimum acceptable return)/down-side standard deviation



Fixed income
1. to fully immunize a portfolio
   PV_A = PV_L/ D_A = D_L/ minimize portfolio convexity
2. when calculate next year's coupon return, (coupon rate * 100)/this year's mkt value
3. when choosing bond portfolio with a yield curve changes, see the portoflio as barbell/bullet/laddered
   don't pay too much attention on the figure, as the change in the long term is far more important than the change in the short term
4. to immunize a single liability  
   -> PV_A = PV_L/ D_A = D_L/ minimize portfolio convexity (to make the cash flow as close as to the liability -> bullet)
   to immunize multiple liabilities 
   -> PV_A = PV_L/ D_A = D_L/ durations of the portfolio have a wider range than the durations of the liabilities (conv_A>conv_L)
5. callable bond -> to buy back the bond -> bond issuer's right -> bond value = bond - call -> increase when yield decrease
   putable bond -> to sell the bond -> bond holder's right -> bond value = bond + put -> increase when yield increase
6. rebate rate = collateral earnings rate - security lending rate
7. to benefit from stable yield curve -> sell convexity -> long bonds with negative convexity (MBS or callable bond)
8. return = yield income (coupon and coupon RI) + roll down return + capital gain (from curve) + expected credit loss + currency gain/loss
9. excess return over the target horizon = (Credit spread x Target horizon) – [(Expected spread – Current spread) x Spread duration]


Derivatives
1. Domestic currency return = (1+ RFC) (1+ RFX) – 1 (PLZ PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BIT)

Alternative 
1. benefits of mkt neutral over long-short
   more diversification from quantitative method/ no constraints stemming from the need for an event or expertise in a specific sector
   lower standard deviation (beta)/ more liquidity since shorter rebalancing window
